# Organization administration

> Manage the people, seats, and settings for a single organization within your agency.

> **Who this portal is for:** Organization owners. If you manage multiple organizations across your agency, see the [Tenant administration](/government/tenant-admin/overview) guide instead.

The organization admin portal is where you manage the people, seats, and settings for a single organization in Claude for Government. It covers the day-to-day work of administering who has access, how much they can use, and how the Claude products behave for your users.

## Key concepts

Before you use the portal, it helps to understand how the pieces fit together.

Your agency's deployment is a **tenant**, which is the top-level container that holds one or more **organizations**. An organization is a self-contained group of users with its own seats, settings, and usage. Most administrators work at the organization level, while tenant administrators oversee all of the organizations together and control tenant-wide resources such as single sign-on, directory provisioning, and billing accounts.

Every person in an organization holds a **role**, which determines whether they can reach this portal at all, and occupies a **seat** on a **seat tier**, which determines which Claude models they can use and how much they can use them. Seat tiers come in two kinds:

* **Anthropic-managed tiers** that are supplied to you as a fixed number of seats.
* **Self-managed tiers** that your organization defines itself and funds from a prepaid **credit** balance.

## Who can access it

You can reach the organization admin portal if your role in the organization is **Owner** or **Primary Owner**. Users who hold the standard **User** role are redirected to their personal account page instead.

> **For tenant administrators:** You can also open this portal for any organization in your tenant. When your tenant contains more than one organization, an **Acting as** selector appears at the top of every admin page so you can choose which organization you are currently managing. All the changes you make while acting as an organization apply to that organization, and the audit trail records your own identity as the actor.

## Getting around

The portal header shows your organization's name, and a navigation bar below it gives you access to each admin page.

<Note>
  If your organization's credit balance crosses a warning threshold, a banner appears just below the navigation on every page of this portal. The banner tells you the percentage of credits used and stays in place until more credits are added to your organization. It escalates in color and wording if usage crosses a higher threshold. Every owner sees the banner, including when funding is managed centrally and the Billing tab is hidden, so that you always know when your organization is running low.
</Note>

> **For owners and tenant administrators:** You can reach the user view from the **Switch to user view** link in the page footer. If you are also a tenant administrator, the footer additionally offers **Switch to tenant view**.

## Pages in this portal

The navigation groups the pages into three sections.

**People**

<Warning>
  The **Billing** tab only appears if you have permission to manage the billing account that funds your organization, the account is active, and your own organization is active on it. If you don't see it, your tenant administrators manage funding centrally and you should contact them to request changes to credits or seat counts.
</Warning>

<Warning>
  The **Group mappings** tab only appears if automatic directory provisioning has been set up for your tenant. If you don't see it, your tenant administrator has not connected a directory, and users are placed by the tenant's routing rules alone.
</Warning>

<Note>
  Single sign-on and the SCIM provisioning connection are configured at the tenant level, so they are managed on the [tenant portal's Identity and access page](/government/tenant-admin/identity-and-access) rather than here.
</Note>

## How changes take effect

Most changes you make in this portal take effect immediately. Changing a user's seat tier, updating a spend limit, or resetting a user's rate limits applies to their very next request. Product configuration changes are picked up the next time a user's Claude application refreshes its settings, which happens when the application is launched or when the user signs in. Group mapping changes trigger an immediate re-sync so you do not need to wait for a scheduled cycle.
