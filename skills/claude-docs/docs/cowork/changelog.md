> Release notes for Claude Desktop

<Update label="v1.20186.0" description="2026-07-09">
  **General**

  * Fixed `claude://` deep links being ignored when opening one launched the app from a closed state, including on Windows and Linux.
  * Fixed device attestation failing on Windows when sending several messages at once.
  * Fixed garbled tool summaries in the transcript: descriptions that don't start with a recognized verb (for example "Final verification") now appear as written instead of being mis-conjugated.
  * Fixed skill proposal and skill-file cards failing to save with "Couldn't save this skill" when a skill of that name already exists; they now offer "Update skill" and a replace confirmation.
  * Fixed the app forgetting your last-used tab (for example Code) after an update or re-login.
  * Fixed the menu bar usage menu showing an empty progress bar for extra usage when the spend cap is unlimited.

  **Code**

  * Added a Troubleshooting option to import Claude Code CLI sessions found on this computer into the session list.
  * Added iOS Simulator and Android Emulator buttons to the session titlebar when the agent launches an app on a device, so the pane is one click to reopen.
  * Fixed a typed `<channel-message>` turn rendering as a spoofable "Message from `{server}`" card instead of as your own text.
  * Fixed cross-session messages going missing in the transcript: messages from another session no longer disappear when they arrive in the same turn as other content or when their envelope can't be fully parsed.
  * Fixed file links to files outside the working directory, including reports Claude writes to its scratchpad, showing "This file is outside the working directory" instead of opening.
  * Fixed the context window indicator and token count staying at the pre-compaction value after compacting a conversation.

  **Cowork**

  * Fixed admin-configured plugin marketplace sync failing behind corporate proxies on macOS.
  * Fixed plugin connectors sometimes missing from the Connectors list and tool permission prompts when they were slow to start.
  * Fixed skills saved in a remote session sometimes still returning "Unknown command" right after saving.
  * Fixed the "Run this task while your Mac sleeps" setting turning itself off after an app update.

  **3P**

  * Added `*` wildcard matching for managed MCP `toolPolicy` keys; partial wildcard keys such as `"outlook_*"` in existing configurations now take effect, including any `allow` wildcards, which pre-approve the tools they match. Exact keys and the standalone `"*"` key behave as before.
  * Added support for exporting Cowork task telemetry over `otlpProtocol: grpc` on macOS and Linux when no network proxy is configured.
  * Fixed Azure AI Foundry sessions failing with an authentication error on every message after interactive Microsoft Entra ID sign-in.
  * Fixed gateway-SSO bootstrap dropping cross-origin `managedMcpServers` entries, so admin-provisioned third-party connectors reach the app under device-code sign-in.
  * Fixed MCP connectors failing to connect through gateways that optionally request a TLS client certificate, even though the connection test passed.
  * Fixed sign-in timing out with identity providers (such as PingFederate) that redirect via a rendered page after authentication.
  * Fixed third-party settings ignoring managed configuration: the Claude Code pane now follows `isClaudeCodeForDesktopEnabled`, the Developer tab hides when `isLocalDevMcpEnabled` is off, and the Capabilities and Voice settings no longer appear.
</Update>

<Update label="v1.19367.0" description="2026-07-07">
  **General**

  * Added automatic updates on Linux through the Anthropic apt repository, so new versions arrive with `apt upgrade` (and unattended upgrades where enabled).
  * Added the ability to archive or delete the current chat, project, task, or coding session directly from the command palette (`⌘K`, or `Ctrl+K` on Windows and Linux).
  * Fixed bank payment-verification (3DS) pages not loading during checkout.
  * Fixed MCP connectors in artifacts being silently dropped; approving a connector now reliably grants its tools to the artifact, and a previously stuck approval heals itself the next time you approve.
  * Fixed repeated crashes on Linux caused by unstable graphics acceleration; the app now turns acceleration off automatically and tells you.
  * Fixed the app becoming unresponsive when a session folder is on a slow or disconnected network drive.

  **Code**

  * Added descriptive branch names for local Code sessions, derived from your first message, in place of the random adjective-noun names.
  * Changed the default transcript and composer width to a narrower, more readable column; a width you already chose in Settings → Appearance is preserved.
  * Fixed "Open in Finder", "Open in editor", and "Attach to chat" doing nothing, or using the wrong path, for files in the diff panel when the session folder differs from the repo folder.
  * Fixed freezes and stalls: while restoring a large number of sessions at startup, while builds or file syncs churned files inside a watched folder, and while the diff panel refreshed during a response.
  * Fixed newly trusted folders sometimes failing to start a session with a "workspace is not trusted" error.
  * Fixed security-key and phone sign-ins not completing in preview tabs.

  **Cowork**

  * Added a copyright-access notice in the session timeline when Claude in Chrome first operates on certain news publisher sites.
  * Added keyboard access to the preview pane: Tab reaches a "Preview page" control, Enter moves focus into the loaded page, and `F6` (or `Ctrl+F6`) moves it back out.
  * Fixed Cowork offering terminal access, and showing an impossible fix suggestion, on devices whose operating system cannot provide the virtualization its isolated environment needs (such as ChromeOS), where every command immediately failed.

  **3P**

  * Added `inferenceFoundryAuthFlow` to choose how interactive Microsoft Entra ID sign-in for Azure AI Foundry runs: `device-code` (the default, which shows a code to enter at `microsoft.com/devicelogin`) or `browser`, which opens the system browser for an authorization-code (PKCE) sign-in.
  * Added `microsoftAuthBroker`; set it to `disabled` to force browser-based Microsoft 365 sign-in instead of the native Company Portal or Windows account broker.
  * Added a "session expires soon" warning for Bedrock SSO and AWS-profile sign-in so you can re-authenticate before hitting an error.
  * Added a `startupTimeoutSec` option for managed local (stdio) MCP servers and raised the default startup timeout from 10 to 120 seconds, fixing connection failures when a server command downloads packages on first run (for example `uvx` or `npx`).
  * Added support for background agents: long-running tasks now stay signed in after your identity provider's access token expires.
  * Added the ability for administrators to grant Microsoft 365 write scopes (send mail; edit calendars and files; send Teams chat; mailbox settings) through managed configuration.
  * (breaking) Changed the default for Desktop Extensions (`.dxt` and `.mcpb`): they no longer load unless you set `isDesktopExtensionEnabled` to `true` in managed configuration. Previously they loaded by default and only the install UI was blocked.
  * Updated `allowedPluginMarketplaces` (beta) so it can be delivered per-user through the bootstrap server; a response that omits the key leaves MDM-provisioned marketplaces in place.
  * Fixed a one-time loss of sign-ins on some managed Windows machines after app data moved to a new location.
  * Fixed AWS credentials not reaching the Code tab's terminal for Amazon Bedrock configurations that use IAM Identity Center.
  * Fixed bundled Microsoft 365 and other MCP connectors failing to connect on networks with corporate TLS inspection (custom root CA).
  * Fixed connection tests reporting false failures: the test now runs MCP helper scripts and checks managed configurations exactly as saved, and uses the same Azure AI Foundry endpoint that sessions use.
  * Fixed managed MCP connectors failing with a credential-storage error when the server allows anonymous access.
  * Fixed the Microsoft 365 connector failing to sign in on Macs enrolled with Microsoft Company Portal.
  * Fixed the setup form incorrectly showing "Blocked address" for internal MCP or OAuth servers on IPv6 enterprise networks.

</Update>

<Update label="v1.18286.0" description="2026-07-02">
  **General**

  * Fixed `apt update` failing on Linux after uninstalling a Claude that was installed from the apt repository.
  * Fixed being asked to sign in repeatedly after a session expired while you were using the app; your in-progress message draft now returns when you sign back in within 10 minutes, and signing out still clears it.
  * Fixed being unable to disable, delete, or uninstall plugins from GitHub-connected marketplaces, or to remove those marketplaces.
  * Fixed pressing Enter not sending your message when an @mention had no matching results.
  * Fixed remote SSH sessions getting stuck in a reconnect loop on very large messages, being lost when the computer woke from sleep mid-reconnect, and occasionally sending the same input twice after reconnecting.
  * Fixed setup on Windows getting stuck retrying a download when the download folder was locked or inaccessible.
  * Fixed the file-open spinner on Linux staying up after the download completed.

  **Code**

  * Added a "Choose folder" option to recover a session whose working folder is missing: the conversation forks into the folder you pick and the stuck session is archived.
  * Added a "Switch organization" option on the "session not found" page so you can reopen a session link under the right organization.
  * Added drag-to-reorder for queued messages, and Steer now works for messages that include images.
  * Improved the Code tab's live preview: it now reports honest connection and loading status (including when a page arrives but never finishes loading, or a server overloads itself with requests), adds browser-style Back, Forward, and Reload/Stop controls, and lets you close other preview tabs.
  * Fixed background tasks and workflows continuing to show as running after they finished, the session restarted, or the session was stopped.
  * Fixed Remote Control sessions spinning forever with no error after you sent a message when the hosting computer was no longer connected.
  * Fixed the sidebar project + button opening an empty prompt (or pointing at github.com) for GitHub Enterprise repositories.

  **Cowork**

  * Added click-to-zoom and drag-to-pan to the fullscreen image viewer.
  * Fixed Computer Use teach mode where the Next and Exit buttons sometimes stopped responding until you switched apps and back, and cleared up teach-mode visuals so the screen-edge glow no longer flickers and the status indicator no longer sticks after you exit a guide.
  * Fixed dictation dropping back to the text box when started from the mic button in existing sessions.
  * Fixed document tools in cloud sessions acting on your local files instead of the session's files.

  **3P**

  * Added a usage breakdown by model family, source attribution, and usage tips to the `/usage` card.
  * Removed automatic addition of Anthropic's default plugin marketplace on third-party deployments, and removed the `disableDefaultPlugins` managed configuration key (which had no effect there). Provision marketplaces via `allowedPluginMarketplaces` (beta).
</Update>

<Update label="v1.17377.2" description="2026-07-01">

  **3P**

  * Added Claude Fable 5 to the model picker for organizations with access.
</Update>

<Update label="v1.17377.1" description="2026-06-30">
  **General**

  * Added Linux support: Claude Desktop is now available for Debian and Ubuntu on x64 and arm64, installable as a .deb package.
  * Updated the plugin Directory to show admin-configured marketplaces under the Organization tab and refresh them automatically when the source repository updates.
  * Fixed plugin and skill downloads stalling for several minutes on a dead connection before retrying; stalled downloads now retry sooner.
  * Fixed prompt and tool-detail content missing from OpenTelemetry exports for standard deployments that have not set an explicit content-capture policy; third-party deployments are unchanged.
  * Changed zoom in and out to use smaller steps for finer control.

  **Code**

  * Added an integrated terminal pane and inline image previews in the transcript for SSH sessions.
  * Added step-by-step progress and a Stop button while a session's worktree is being set up, so a long checkout on a large repository can be cancelled.
  * Added a right-click menu in the Terminal pane with Copy, Paste, and Attach selection as context.
  * Updated the transcript to mask API keys and tokens by default; click the eye icon to reveal them.
  * Fixed folder access and cross-session requests being rejected after you approved them when permission mode was Auto or Bypass permissions.
  * Fixed failed mid-turn message sends (for example, while offline) dropping your text instead of returning it to the input.
  * Fixed new session worktrees branching from the currently checked-out branch instead of the repository's default branch, and archived sessions leaving their worktree folders on disk.

  **Cowork**

  * Fixed a crash when resuming sessions with malformed remote connector data on disk.
  * Fixed the workspace download restarting from zero after a network interruption; it now resumes from where it left off and retries automatically.
  * Fixed folder and file names containing a dollar sign being misread, which broke file references.
  * Fixed dictation immediately dropping back to the text input in existing sessions.
  * Fixed an error caused by Claude trying to read a document creation skill that was not available.
  * Fixed clicking a built-in workflow (such as `deep-research`) in the activity panel's Skills section showing an empty drawer instead of its name and source.

  **3P**

  * Added the `allowedPluginMarketplaces` managed configuration key. Configured git repositories appear under the Directory's Organization tab.
  * Added an optional `omitOfflineAccess` subfield to the `inferenceVertexWorkforceOidc` configuration. Enable it when an identity provider rejects the `offline_access` scope; the app then prompts for sign-in each time the identity provider token expires instead of refreshing silently.
  * Added managed configuration support on Linux: administrators can provision settings in a root-owned `/etc/claude-desktop/managed-settings.json`, validated against the same schema as the macOS and Windows sources.
  * Fixed claude.ai sign-in never completing on Windows when an enterprise inference provider is configured.
  * Fixed subagents failing with an invalid model error on third-party inference providers.
  * Fixed `inferenceModels[].supports1m` being ignored, restoring the 1M-context option in the model picker for Bedrock, Vertex, Foundry, and gateway providers.
  * Fixed the Microsoft 365 connector showing an unexpected admin-consent prompt after updating on tenants with restrictive consent policies when the connector's Access setting was blank. Also updated the bundled connector with tools to read the signed-in user's profile and draft reply-all emails.
  * Improved expired sign-in handling for third-party inference providers and connectors: a sign-in prompt now appears whichever credential type expired, connector authentication errors are shown in Settings and inline in chat with a Reconnect action, and background Code sessions stay signed in across a credential refresh.
  * Fixed several connector reliability issues: connectors silently stopping mid-session after an OAuth refresh failed instead of prompting to reconnect, connectors configured with both OAuth sign-in and custom headers failing to connect, and admin-configured connectors not appearing in a session until they were signed in.

  * Fixed Microsoft 365 brokered sign-in failing with "No reply address provided" on managed Macs.
</Update>

<Update label="v1.15962.0" description="2026-06-25">
  **General**

  * Fixed a crash on launch caused by an unusually large saved session.
  * Fixed the conversation jumping and the Progress panel flashing when opening a completed task.
  * Improved keyboard navigation: a message's action buttons are now a single Tab stop, with arrow keys to move between them.

  **Code**

  * Fixed high background CPU usage when several Code sessions were open in the same large repository.
  * Fixed people without a Claude Code seat being sent to the marketing site from `/code`; they now see an in-app organization switcher.
  * Added support for custom cron expressions when scheduling local routines.
  * Added "Open in VS Code", "Open in Cursor", and similar actions to the file panel, file tree, plan panel, titlebar, and sidebar in SSH sessions.
  * Fixed attachment cards for files that exist only inside a session doing nothing when clicked; they now open in the File pane, lightbox, Preview pane, or Files browser.
  * Added a "Load more" button to the All sessions list for people with many sessions.

  **Cowork**

  * Fixed workspace setup repeatedly failing with the same checksum error after a corrupted download, until the cache was cleared.
  * Fixed Cowork sessions losing their project after restarting the app.
  * Added a one-time prompt before Claude runs a dynamic workflow, explaining what workflows do.
  * Improved the time it takes to start a session.

  **3P**

  * Added a managed `websearch` built-in tool so self-hosted deployments can search the web. Admins configure Brave, Tavily, Exa, or a custom endpoint in managed config, and it is available in both the Cowork and Code tabs.
  * Added an `otlpContentCapture` managed setting that lets admins opt in to sending specific categories of unredacted content — user prompts, assistant responses, tool inputs, tool outputs, and raw API request/response bodies — to their OTLP collector.
  * Updated the Microsoft 365 built-in connector's `scope` field to accept `MailboxSettings.Read`.
  * Fixed managed connectors that lost their connection staying broken with failing tool calls; they now reconnect automatically on the next tool call, including from newly started conversations, and show a message if reconnecting fails.
  * Fixed Microsoft 365 connector sign-in failing on Windows because of a broker error.
  * Fixed a sign-in loop when your organization's gateway denies access; the app now shows "Access denied" and points you to your administrator.
  * Fixed the selected model reverting after restarting the app and resuming a session.
  * Added a `disableBundledSkills` managed config key that turns off Claude Code's bundled skills and workflows (such as `deep-research`) on that device.
</Update>

<Update label="v1.15200.0" description="2026-06-23">
  **General**

  * No user-facing changes.

  **Code**

  * Added an inline card for multiple-choice questions from Claude, so you can pick an option and step through each question before your choices are sent as a single reply.
  * Fixed the app crashing shortly after opening the Code tab when local session history files are very large.
  * Fixed the integrated terminal eventually failing to open new shells after the app had been running for several days on macOS.
  * Fixed forked sessions not carrying over pull requests from the original conversation, and pull request rows staying marked as closed after being reopened on GitHub.
  * Fixed the @-mention dropdown, side-chat panel, and plan-comment popover rendering, resizing, and dismissing in the wrong window when a session is opened in its own window.
  * Fixed an extra tab opening in the system browser when navigating with the Artifacts pane open.

  **Cowork**

  * Added the ability to delete Cowork sessions from the sidebar, recents, and Spaces views.

  **3P**

  * Published the v2 bootstrap-response JSON schema (nested format). The v1 flat schema remains supported.
  * Removed support for installing connector extensions from local `.mcpb` and `.dxt` files.
  * Fixed the Setup panel being locked when only the auto-update policy was deployed via MDM.
  * Fixed connectors configured by your organization not appearing until restart after first sign-in.
  * Fixed the model picker dropping to "Default model" mid-session when a gateway's model-list response was temporarily degraded.
</Update>

<Update label="v1.14271.0" description="2026-06-18">
  **General**

  * Fixed the app prompting you to sign in again every day when your claude.ai session was more than a day old.
  * Fixed Claude Design links in chat navigating the app in place instead of opening Claude Design.
  * Fixed the app showing a blank window when a network proxy redirects the connection to Claude.

  **Code**

  * Changed routines to count against your regular usage limits instead of a separate daily included-run limit, and removed the included-runs indicator.
  * Updated the model picker to show restricted models as non-selectable with an explanatory badge, and to reflect your organization's allowed default model.
  * Fixed HTML and SVG file previews showing black text on a dark background in dark mode.
  * Fixed menus and popovers opening behind the preview panel.

  **Cowork**

  * Fixed Claude in Chrome file uploads failing for files in the session's shared folders and outputs.
  * Fixed scheduled tasks leaving earlier processes running after each scheduled run.
  * Fixed Windows file paths showing garbled characters in the folder access approval card, and reduced unnecessary folder access denials when allowed workspace folders are configured.

  **3P**

  * (breaking) Changed the `chatCodeExecutionEnabled` managed configuration key to `chatAdvancedFileAnalysisEnabled`. It still lets Claude analyze attached files such as spreadsheets and presentations by running code in a sandbox scoped to the session's attachments, and remains off by default. Update any managed configuration that sets the old key.
  * Deprecated the `betaFeaturesEnabled` managed configuration key; use the per-feature keys `chatTabEnabled` and `chatAdvancedFileAnalysisEnabled` instead. The Beta label in the Setup window is now informational only, and the Beta label has been removed from the built-in Microsoft 365 connector presets.
  * Added the `inferenceSessionLifetimeSec` managed configuration key. Set it to your identity provider's session lifetime to show users a re-authenticate reminder before their sign-in expires.
  * Added `~` and environment variable expansion (such as `%APPDATA%` and `%OneDriveCommercial%`) to the `allowedWorkspaceFolders` setting, so folder paths can vary per user.
  * Added a per-folder pre-select option to `allowedWorkspaceFolders` so an administrator-configured folder can appear as a ready chip when users start a new task, and removed the "Create workspace folder?" prompt for administrator-configured folders.
</Update>

<Update label="v1.13576.0" description="2026-06-16">
  **General**

  * Improved find-in-page to search the entire session transcript instead of only the text scrolled into view, and the find bar now reliably takes keyboard focus when opened.
  * Added a unified Artifacts view that lists your chat, Code, and Cowork artifacts in one searchable place, with a "New artifact" menu and a "Filter by" control to narrow the list by source.
  * Fixed keyboard shortcut conflicts failing silently. Assigning a shortcut already held by another app now tells you and keeps your previous shortcut working, and Quick Entry registration errors now appear in Settings.
  * Fixed the first-run notification explaining that Claude keeps running in the notification area never appearing on Windows.

  **Code**

  * Added running dev servers to the Background tasks panel, with stop and open-preview actions.
  * Improved the Code file viewer: images, video, and audio now play inline instead of showing as text, and Markdown, CSV, and image files refresh automatically when Claude edits them.
  * Updated the model picker. The three headline models appear at the top level with older models and context-size variants under "More models", each model shows a capability description, and currently-unavailable models appear disabled instead of failing when selected.
  * Updated the in-session artifact panel: switch between a session's published artifacts from the title dropdown, see when an artifact was last updated, copy a share link, and open, share, or delete the artifact from the overflow menu.
  * Changed the Code sessions tab from "Projects" to "All sessions". It now lists your non-project sessions alongside project sessions and adds a multi-select Environment filter.
  * Fixed pull request status checks. Failures now show a small warning indicator on the branch row instead of repeated error popups, the "status couldn't be checked" warning appears less often and can always be dismissed, and only GitHub CLI sign-in problems still raise a notification.

  **Cowork**

  * Fixed corrupt plugin downloads crashing or hanging the app.
  * Fixed skills sometimes staying on an older version after being edited until toggled off and on.

  **3P**

  * Added the Chat tab as a beta feature controlled by the `chatTabEnabled` managed configuration key. The separate `chatCodeExecutionEnabled` key lets Claude analyze attachments and create files such as spreadsheets and presentations by running code in an isolated sandbox scoped to the session's attachments, and is off by default.
  * Added the `betaFeaturesEnabled` managed configuration key. Setting it to false disables every beta feature in the deployment, including the Chat tab.
  * Added Bedrock Mantle as an inference provider option. It reuses the existing `inferenceBedrockRegion` and `inferenceBedrockBaseUrl` managed configuration keys and authenticates with a bearer token or a credential helper.
  * Added `anthropicFamilyTier` and `isFamilyDefault` to managed `inferenceModels` entries. Tag each configured model with the Claude tier it stands in for so tier shortcuts like opus and sonnet resolve to your configured model IDs instead of the canonical names your provider may not route.
  * Added the `inferenceBedrockAwsCliPath` managed configuration key to set the AWS CLI's absolute path. This fixes aws sso login failing when the app is launched from Finder on macOS and the CLI is not on the default search path.
  * Fixed Google Workspace connectors never starting their OAuth sign-in. The MCP client identifier the app sends to connected servers is now `claude-desktop-3p`, changed from `custom3p-desktop`, so update any MCP server allowlists or log filters that match the old value.
  * Fixed the managed Tool policy `*` entry being ignored. It now applies as the default for any tool not listed by name.
  * Fixed organization plugins sometimes not opening from the Directory right after launch or update.
  * Fixed several connection and sign-in issues: Bedrock sessions now prompt to sign in again after AWS IAM Identity Center expires instead of failing with repeated credential errors, remote MCP connectors no longer stay Connected after a non-refreshable access token expires, the connection test now passes against gateways that optionally request a TLS client certificate, signing in after signing out no longer needs a double click, and sign-in recovery no longer uses stale configuration after a server-side update or leaves the model picker empty until restart.
</Update>

<Update label="v1.12603.1" description="2026-06-11">
  **General**

  * Added Find Next and Find Previous keyboard shortcuts to in-app search.
  * Fixed preview panes stealing keyboard focus from the chat input when they reloaded or navigated.
  * Fixed sessions failing to start after your sign-in expired — the app now prompts you to sign in again.

  **Code**

  * Added the Files panel to remote and SSH sessions — search the session's files and open them in the viewer — plus a Show in Files button in the file viewer.
  * Added a running-tasks button to the activity indicator that opens the Tasks panel, and Bash rows in the Background tasks panel now open to show their output, including a live tail while the command runs.
  * Fixed SSH sessions: forking no longer opens an empty conversation, and connections no longer fail with "Failed to upload file" errors on remotes first set up by early-2026 versions of the app.
  * Fixed renaming a session while its title was still generating — the generated title no longer overwrites the name you set.
  * Fixed the Pull Requests view showing "No open pull requests" when GitHub isn't connected — it now prompts you to connect.
  * Added model-picker memory — the picker now remembers your last model choice.

  **Cowork**

  * Fixed scheduled tasks firing many duplicate runs at once when the computer wakes from sleep.
  * Fixed remote sessions re-prompting for access to folders you had already trusted.
  * Fixed plugins becoming corrupted when they synced while you switched accounts.

  **3P**

  * Added the built-in Microsoft 365 connector — admins can configure it from the Setup window's server presets. Users sign in through their browser, and Claude can search and read Microsoft 365 mail, calendar, OneDrive, and SharePoint. It requests read-only access by default; admins can grant additional read scopes, such as Teams channel messages and meeting transcripts, with the managed server entry's scope setting.
  * Deprecated the "sso" value for the inferenceGatewayAuthScheme managed configuration key in favor of inferenceCredentialKind "interactive" — existing configurations keep working and log a deprecation warning.
  * Added the inferenceVertexOAuthLoginHint managed configuration key to pre-fill the Google account chooser when signing in to Vertex AI, so users in organizations federated to a third-party identity provider land on the right account automatically.
</Update>

<Update label="v1.11847.5" description="2026-06-09">
  **General**

  * Fixed Clear Cache and Restart signing you out instead of just clearing caches.
  * Fixed mouse back and forward buttons not navigating on macOS for mice managed by driver software like Logitech Options+, and added trackpad swipe navigation.
  * Fixed organization plugins sometimes failing to open right after app launch, and the plugin directory now offers Install again after an uninstall.
  * Fixed connector, Chrome extension, and plugin toggles in the composer's "+" menu not responding when you click directly on the switch.
  * Fixed an issue where signing in could leave the app unable to start sessions until it was restarted.
  * Fixed shell-exported custom request headers not reaching Claude Code sessions.

  **Code**

  * Fixed Claude losing its coding instructions, file-link formatting, and worktree context after a session resumed from idle.
  * Fixed the preview pane sometimes connecting to an unrelated dev server that was already using the configured port, and it now reopens the dev server you last picked for each project.
  * Improved responsiveness in Code sessions: smoother streaming of long code blocks, quicker side-panel shortcuts, and less delay opening cloud sessions with many screenshots.
  * Fixed popovers, dialogs, and the rewind picker not appearing — and typed characters jumping to the end of the composer — when a Code session is opened in its own window.
  * Fixed the slash-command menu opening behind the side chat panel.
  * Fixed the source-branch picker showing nothing for SSH sessions with worktree enabled.

  **Cowork**

  * Added a "Free Up Cowork Disk Space" option under Help > Troubleshooting, and Cowork now cleans up caches and old temporary files automatically when its workspace disk runs low.
  * Improved the read/unread toggle on sidebar sessions: it now works on the currently open session, has a larger click target, and shows a tooltip describing what a click will do.

  **3P**

  * Added support for the Fable model family, and for Mythos where your organization has access.
  * Fixed sign-in failing with external identity providers that reject the offline\_access scope — admins can now disable the automatic append.
</Update>

<Update label="v1.11187.4" description="2026-06-05">
  **General**

  * Fixed reinstalling Claude on Windows failing after an uninstall when IT had installed it for all users.
  * Fixed the app not starting automatically at login on Windows.
  * Added a banner when an update fails to install, instead of failing silently.
  * Fixed built-in connectors staying disconnected after a crash — existing sessions now reconnect them automatically, and disconnecting a built-in connector now signs it out and keeps it disconnected across restarts.

  **Code**

  * Added math rendering for inline and block expressions in Claude Code transcripts.
  * Added Ultracode to the effort slider, which selects the highest effort level and turns on dynamic workflows for the session.
  * Added drag-to-reorder and A→Z sorting for projects in the Claude Code sidebar.
  * Added triple-click to select a whole code block, plus right-click menu actions to copy a code block or inline code, in Claude Code transcripts.
  * Fixed resuming Code sessions when the working folder had moved or been deleted — sessions saved with a \~ path no longer show as missing or re-prompt for trust, and a deleted remote folder now reports clearly and offers a Fork session button instead of retrying in a loop.

  **Cowork**

  * Added a low-disk-space warning before Cowork downloads the files it needs to run.
  * Added in-session effort and thinking controls for local Cowork projects.
  * Updated the New project folder picker to default to your Claude data folder (\~/Claude/Projects) instead of \~/Documents.
  * Fixed Claude reporting that a skill was updated when the change was never saved to your account.
  * Fixed the /schedule command in Cowork showing as unavailable.

  **3P**

  * Fixed managed connectors and SSO sign-in requesting broader OAuth scopes than the administrator configured.
  * Fixed three Bedrock sign-in and session issues: SSO sign-in failing behind corporate proxies that intercept secure traffic, expired SSO tokens prompting a new sign-in every hour instead of refreshing automatically, and resumed sessions failing on their first message.
