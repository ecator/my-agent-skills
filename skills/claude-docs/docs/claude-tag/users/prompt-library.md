# Prompt library

> Copy-paste prompts for Claude Tag in Slack, each with why it works. See first messages, channel-behavior asks, memory checks, routine setup, and mid-thread steering.

export const BetaNote = () => <Info>Claude Tag is in public beta. Features and behavior described here may change before general availability.</Info>;

<BetaNote />

These prompts are ready to copy, paste, and adapt: swap in your own channel names, services, and repositories. Each comes with the reason it works, so you can keep the mechanism when you change the words.

## First messages in a new channel

Ask what Claude can access from this channel:

```text wrap theme={null}
@Claude what can you access from this channel?
```

**Why it works**: what Claude can do differs per channel, and without this grounding it may suggest tasks it can't do here.

Get a personalized starting point:

```text wrap theme={null}
@Claude learn what you can about my role from this workspace, then tell me three tasks you could take off my plate this week.
```

**Why it works**: it's a discovery task with a bounded output. "Three tasks" gives you a list you can judge in ten seconds, and the answer doubles as a menu of next tasks.

Start with a low-stakes task:

```text wrap theme={null}
@Claude catch me up on this channel since Monday.
```

**Why it works**: "since Monday" bounds the task, and you can grade the result yourself because you were there.

## Shape how the channel works

The prompts below set channel-wide behavior that applies to every thread, not just yours.

```text wrap theme={null}
@Claude remember for this channel: keep replies short, and always include a link to the source.
```

**Why it works**: "remember for this channel" is the explicit save instruction; preferences mentioned in passing usually aren't kept.

```text wrap theme={null}
@Claude stay quiet in this channel unless tagged.
```

**Why it works**: it's stated as standing channel behavior, so it persists instead of lasting one conversation.

## Check and correct memory

```text wrap theme={null}
@Claude what do you remember about this channel?
```

**Why it works**: memory is a curated note and Claude decides what's worth keeping, so checking is the only way to know what stuck.

```text wrap theme={null}
@Claude that's outdated — forget the entry about the old project name.
```

**Why it works**: it names the specific entry. "Clean up your memory" makes Claude guess what's stale; naming the entry doesn't.

```text wrap theme={null}
@Claude update your memory for this channel so this doesn't happen again.
```

**Why it works**: a correction in a thread fixes that thread only. This sentence is what turns it into a standing fix that applies to everyone's future threads.

## Manage routines

Create, audit, and stop the scheduled jobs Claude runs in this channel. For paste-ready schedules by scenario, like a daily standup summary or a weekly digest, see [Routine recipes](/claude-tag/users/proactivity#routine-recipes).

```text wrap theme={null}
@Claude every Friday at 3pm, post a summary of this week's requests: how many, top themes, and anything still unrouted.
```

**Why it works**: the schedule is specific, and the post's contents are named, so every rollup has the same shape and is comparable to last week's. "Anything still unrouted" turns a recap into a sweep: nothing gets dropped silently.

```text wrap theme={null}
@Claude what routines do you have set up in this channel?
```

**Why it works**: schedules are channel state, and someone else may have set them up. Auditing first beats creating a duplicate digest.

```text wrap theme={null}
@Claude disable the daily digest job.
```

**Why it works**: it names which job. Any channel member can disable a scheduled job; you don't need to find an admin to stop a noisy routine.

## Steer work mid-thread

Reply in the same thread; once Claude is working there, you don't need to @-mention it again.

```text wrap theme={null}
Status check — what's done and what's left?
```

**Why it works**: the reply lands in the session that's running the task, with full context. Asking in a new thread instead queues a second session that knows nothing about the first.

```text wrap theme={null}
Change of plan: target the staging config instead, and post the diff here before applying anything.
```

**Why it works**: redirecting in-thread keeps everything the session has already learned. "Post the diff here before applying" adds a checkpoint, so the channel reviews the change before it lands.

```text wrap theme={null}
Post the draft to the thread, or commit and push what you have, then keep going.
```

**Why it works**: the thread is durable but [the isolated workspace behind it isn't](/claude-tag/concepts/how-it-works#what-survives-between-replies). Work posted to the thread or pushed to a branch survives idle recycling; files that exist only in that workspace don't.

## Task starters, by shape

Each entry in the use case library gets one starter here; the linked page has the full setup and the reasoning behind its prompts.
