# Use case library

> Shapes of work teams hand Claude Tag in Slack, each with prompts to paste. See triage, catch-up, docs and tickets, project tracking, data, deals, monitoring, and bug fixes.

export const BetaNote = () => <Info>Claude Tag is in public beta. Features and behavior described here may change before general availability.</Info>;

<BetaNote />

Each use case below links to a page with prompts to paste, what it needs connected, and how to set it up to [run on a schedule or watch the channel](/claude-tag/users/proactivity) instead of asking each time.

<Note>If `@Claude` doesn't autocomplete in your workspace, your admin hasn't enabled Claude Tag. Send them the [setup guide](/claude-tag/admins/setup-overview).</Note>

## Use cases by connection

A connection is a tool an admin linked for the channel. Each one adds a category of work; ask `@Claude what can you access from this channel?` to see which your channel has.

| Connection         | Examples                         | What it adds                                                                                                                            |
