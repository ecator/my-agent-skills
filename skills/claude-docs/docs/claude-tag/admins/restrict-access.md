# Restrict where Claude Tag operates

> Claude Tag responds only where it has been added and addressed. See who can invoke it, guest and externally shared channel limits, the per-scope version setting, and how to quiet or remove it.

export const BetaNote = () => <Info>Claude Tag is in public beta. Features and behavior described here may change before general availability.</Info>;

<BetaNote />

In channels, Claude Tag responds only where it's been added and addressed, and the controls on this page narrow that further. DMs are a separate surface that runs on the user's own account; see [how DMs differ from channels](/claude-tag/concepts/agent-identity#direct-message-channels).

<Note>Most controls on this page require the Owner role in your Claude organization; the [permissions table](#permissions-by-role) below lists which actions an Admin or a channel member can take.</Note>

## Control who can invoke Claude Tag

In channels where the app has been added, an @-mention guarantees a response; Claude may also respond to a message that doesn't mention it when it judges a reply is warranted, and once a thread is active it follows replies in that thread. By default, anyone in such a channel can address it. A single toggle narrows that to people in your Claude organization.

### Restrict who can use Claude

Open **Manage** on the Slack entry under **Where Claude Tag works** at [`claude.ai/admin-settings/claude-tag`](https://claude.ai/admin-settings/claude-tag). The dialog shows a toggle that controls who in your Slack workspace can use Claude at all; its label depends on your plan. You must be an Owner or Admin of your Claude organization to change it.

| Plan       | Toggle                                     | Off (default)                                                                         | On                                                                                   |
| :--------- | :----------------------------------------- | :------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ | :----------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Enterprise | **Restrict in your organization via RBAC** | Anyone in the connected Slack workspace can use Claude, even without a Claude account | Only members whose role grants the **Claude Tag in Slack** capability can use Claude |
| Team       | **Restrict to your organization**          | Anyone in the connected Slack workspace can use Claude, even without a Claude account | Only Slack users with a Claude account in your organization can use Claude           |

The toggle applies to channels and DMs alike.

<Info>
  You may see the earlier three-option **Members** dropdown instead of the toggle. The dialog keeps the dropdown while your organization's stored choice matches neither toggle state. That happens for an Enterprise organization that previously chose **Open to any organization member** (now marked deprecated), and for a Team organization still restricted by role from an earlier Enterprise plan. Switch to one of the toggle's two states. The dropdown is then replaced by the toggle, and the deprecated option is no longer offered.
</Info>

#### Restrict by role on Enterprise

Role restriction requires an Enterprise plan. Team plans don't have role-level control; turning on **Restrict to your organization** is the only restriction available there.

Restricting by role spans three console pages.

1. On [`claude.ai/admin-settings/claude-tag`](https://claude.ai/admin-settings/claude-tag), turn on **Restrict in your organization via RBAC**.
2. On [`claude.ai/admin-settings/groups`](https://claude.ai/admin-settings/groups), create groups and add the relevant members.
3. On [`claude.ai/admin-settings/roles`](https://claude.ai/admin-settings/roles), create a custom role with the **Claude Tag in Slack** capability turned on or off, and choose which groups hold the role in the role editor.

Three rules govern how role restrictions resolve.

* **The toggle gates the capability.** The **Claude Tag in Slack** capability on a role has no effect until **Restrict in your organization via RBAC** is on. While the toggle is off, every member can use Claude regardless of what their role grants.
* **Built-in roles always grant access.** Every built-in role, including User, Owner, and Primary owner, grants **Claude Tag in Slack** automatically, so the restriction only blocks members on a custom role that doesn't grant it.
* **Any grant wins.** A member in more than one group keeps access if any of their roles grants it.

A member whose roles don't grant the capability is excluded everywhere Claude works, in three ways:

* **@-mentions and DMs get a private notice.** Claude doesn't act on the request. The member sees a notice only they can see, saying their role doesn't allow Claude Tag and to ask their admin for access.
* **Automatic replies skip them.** In channels where Claude responds without being tagged, a restricted member's messages never trigger a response.
* **Their thread replies aren't read.** In a thread an allowed member started, a restricted member's replies don't reach Claude as content. Claude sees that a message arrived, but the message body is withheld.

<Warning>On a Slack Enterprise Grid whose workspaces are paired to different Claude organizations, one organization's access settings govern the entire grid, so your restrictions may not be enforced in your own workspaces.</Warning>

## Control where Claude Tag operates

The restriction toggle decides who can use Claude. The controls in this section decide where it works at all, from one channel up to a workspace, and which generation answers in each scope (a scope is a channel, a workspace, or your whole organization).

### Quiet or remove Claude Tag

Six ways to stop Claude Tag from responding, ordered from quietest to most complete:

1. **Ask it to stay quiet.** Saying "stay quiet in this thread unless tagged" stops Claude following an active thread.
2. **Remove it from the channel.** Run `/remove @Claude`. It can no longer read or post there.
3. **Set the scope's Claude Tag version to Off.** Claude stops responding in that scope even if someone invites it back; an @-mention gets a disabled notice instead of a reply. The control is on the scope's panel at [`claude.ai/admin-settings/claude-tag`](https://claude.ai/admin-settings/claude-tag), and only an Owner can change it.
4. **Detach the scope.** The channel loses its elevated access and falls back to inherited baselines.
5. **Delete the bundle.** This revokes its credentials everywhere it was attached (the credentials are removed; memory, routines, and transcripts are not). Running sessions may keep a revoked credential for a short window before the change propagates.
6. **Uninstall the app.** This removes Claude from the workspace entirely.

Steps 1–4 and 6 do not delete any data. Step 5 (deleting a bundle) removes the credentials in that bundle; memory, routines, and session transcripts are unaffected by any of these steps. Removing Claude from a channel stops it responding there; the channel's memory and routines remain on record, and re-adding it restores them. Credentials are stored in Access bundles on the claude.ai side and persist independently of the Slack app installation. To delete data, use the dedicated controls at [`claude.ai/admin-settings/claude-tag`](https://claude.ai/admin-settings/claude-tag) rather than removal alone.

### Restrict guest channels

By default, Claude is disabled in any channel that includes a Slack guest. To allow it there, set **Allow Claude to respond to guests** to **Allow** for the scope covering the channel; **Restrict** (the default) keeps it off wherever a guest is present. The setting is at [`claude.ai/admin-settings/claude-tag`](https://claude.ai/admin-settings/claude-tag), on the **Slack** tab under **Claude Tag's access**, in the scope's collapsed **Advanced** section.

**Allow** applies to every guest channel the scope covers, and guests in those channels can see Claude's replies and interact with it. To open one channel rather than a whole workspace, set it on the channel's own scope.

### Externally shared channels

Claude doesn't operate in Slack Connect channels, the ones shared with another company. It's off in those channels regardless of scope or bundle, and this isn't configurable.

The same applies to a channel shared across more than one workspace inside your Enterprise Grid, or across more than one workspace that has its own Claude connection. Claude won't reply in those channels and posts a refusal message instead. There is no per-channel override.

### Migrate from the earlier Claude in Slack

If your organization used the earlier Claude in Slack app, you choose which generation answers `@Claude` per scope. The control is the **Claude Tag version** setting on each workspace or channel scope at [`claude.ai/admin-settings/claude-tag`](https://claude.ai/admin-settings/claude-tag), with the choices **Off**, **Legacy**, **New**, and **Inherit**, plus the **Claude Tag version** row on the **Default Slack access** scope above them.

Both generations answer through the same @Claude app, so **Off** turns off both. To opt out of Claude Tag but keep the earlier app answering in a scope, choose **Legacy**.

Access bundles only apply where the New version answers. The [glossary](/claude-tag/concepts/glossary#the-earlier-claude-in-slack) covers how the two differ.

### Allow or disable direct messages

The **Allow direct messages** toggle (in the Slack entry's **Manage** dialog under **Where Claude Tag works** at [`claude.ai/admin-settings/claude-tag`](https://claude.ai/admin-settings/claude-tag)) controls whether members can message Claude directly. When off, Claude is reachable only in channels. The default is on.

### Set spend limits

Spend limits and usage analytics live at [`claude.ai/admin-settings/usage/claude-tag`](https://claude.ai/admin-settings/usage/claude-tag), a different page than the main Claude Tag settings.

* **Organization-wide limit.** Caps total Claude Tag spend across every channel.
* **Per-channel limits.** Set on any channel that has its own scope, in addition to the organization limit.
* **Usage analytics.** Per-channel spend breakdown on the same page.

Work that would exceed a limit is declined rather than silently truncated. A user blocked by a limit can request more usage from their admin in Slack, and the admin notification names whether the wallet or the limit caused the block.

## Permissions by role

Creating bundles, binding them to scopes, and pairing workspaces need an Owner; an Admin can edit a bundle's Credentials and Domains tabs but not its other tabs. Everything else happens inside the channel and is open to its members. The table lists each action and who can take it.

| Action                                                     | Owner               | Admin               | Channel member                                                                                                                                 |

Scheduled jobs run with the channel's credentials, so a member creating one can't reach anything the channel itself can't.

## Controls that aren't available

These are controls an admin might look for that Claude Tag doesn't have.

* **Third-party deployment.** Sessions run on Anthropic's first-party infrastructure; Claude Tag isn't available through third-party deployments.
* **Renaming or rebranding the app.** The Claude app's name, @-handle, and avatar in Slack are fixed; there is no per-workspace rename setting.
* **A pre-invite channel blocklist.** Once the app is installed in a workspace, anyone can `/invite @Claude` into a public channel; there's no list that prevents the invite itself. To keep Claude out of a channel after the fact, [set that scope's Claude Tag version to Off](#quiet-or-remove-claude-tag).
* **Per-user spend caps on channel work.** Spend limits apply at the organization and channel level. There's no way to cap what one member can spend in channels; DM usage bills to that member's own seat and follows the seat's usual limits.
* **Per-channel responder allowlist.** The restriction toggle governs who can invoke Claude across the workspace; you can't narrow it to a list of people for one channel only.
* **An open-internet switch in Claude Tag settings.** A channel sandbox reaches only allowed hosts. To let Claude reach a public site or API, an Owner or Admin adds that hostname on a [bundle's Domains tab](/claude-tag/admins/add-connections#allow-a-host-without-a-credential); for broad web access, they pin an [environment](/claude-tag/concepts/glossary#environment) whose network access level is Full on the scope. [Allow-all egress](/claude-tag/admins/add-connections#allow-all-hosts), a `*` entry on the Domains tab, is off by default and enabled per organization by Anthropic.
* **A web search toggle for channels.** No setting turns web search off for channel sessions; the web search capability setting in claude.ai admin settings governs claude.ai chat, not channels. Web search runs on Anthropic's servers rather than from the channel sandbox, so Domains entries and egress settings don't govern it, and a search opens no new path out of the sandbox; search requests travel to Anthropic the same way the session's model traffic already does. See [Web search vs. network requests](/claude-tag/concepts/agent-identity#web-search-vs-network-requests).
* **Read-scope confinement.** Claude can search public channels by keyword the same way any Slack user can; it can't read a channel's full history unless it's been added there. There's no setting to disable workspace search.
* **Session length enforcement.** Your organization's Slack session-length policy is not enforced on this surface.
