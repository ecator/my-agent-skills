# Connect Datadog

> Connect Datadog to Claude Tag so it can query metrics, logs, and monitors. Covers the dedicated account to create, the API key fields, and the URL to allow.

export const BetaNote = () => <Info>Claude Tag is in public beta. Features and behavior described here may change before general availability.</Info>;

<BetaNote />

<Note>Connections are added inside an [Access bundle](/claude-tag/admins/add-connections#your-first-access-bundle). At [`claude.ai/admin-settings/claude-tag`](https://claude.ai/admin-settings/claude-tag), open **Access bundles** in the left navigation, click into a bundle (or **Create** one), and go to its **Credentials** tab.</Note>

Connecting Datadog lets Claude query metrics, logs, and monitors during debugging from any channel under the bundle's scope. You add it as a connection inside an [Access bundle](/claude-tag/admins/add-connections); the credential belongs to the agent, not to any person.

Pair this connection with the Datadog plugin from Anthropic's plugin marketplace so Claude knows how to call the API; see [Attach plugins](/claude-tag/admins/add-connections#attach-plugins). This is an HTTP API connection, not an MCP server or a personal claude.ai connector.

## Create the credential in Datadog

Create both an API key and an Application key under a service account in Datadog. The Application key carries the read scopes; restrict it to read-only roles.

Datadog's own guide for creating the credential is at [docs.datadoghq.com](https://docs.datadoghq.com/account_management/api-app-keys/).

## Add the connection to a bundle

In the bundle, click **Connect** next to Datadog. The picker has two Datadog entries: **Datadog** for accounts on `api.datadoghq.com` (US1, the default site) and **Datadog (US5)** for accounts on `api.us5.datadoghq.com`. Pick the one that matches your Datadog site.

| Field                    | Value                                                         |
| :----------------------- | :------------------------------------------------------------ |
| Claude's API key         | The api key from Datadog                                      |
| Claude's application key | The application key from Datadog                              |
| Allowed websites         | Prefilled by the preset; override for other sites (see below) |

Datadog has a separate API host per site, and a key only works against its own. If your account is on a site other than US1 or US5, override Allowed websites with your site's API host: `api.us3.datadoghq.com`, `api.datadoghq.eu`, `api.ap1.datadoghq.com`, or `api.ddog-gov.com`. To change the host later, open the **⋮** menu on this connection in the bundle's Credentials tab and choose **Edit**.

The Agent Proxy injects the credential at the network boundary; the model and the sandbox are not given the key. See [how Agent Proxy works](/claude-tag/concepts/agent-identity#agent-proxy).

## Verify the connection

In a channel under the bundle's scope, in a new thread:

```text wrap theme={null}
@Claude what can you access from this channel?
```

Datadog appears in the list once the connection is live. New connections apply to new threads only.
