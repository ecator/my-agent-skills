# Connect Salesforce

> Connect Salesforce to Claude Tag so it can read and update CRM records. Covers Connected App setup and the OAuth JWT bearer flow Salesforce requires.

export const BetaNote = () => <Info>Claude Tag is in public beta. Features and behavior described here may change before general availability.</Info>;

<BetaNote />

<Note>Connections are added inside an [Access bundle](/claude-tag/admins/add-connections#your-first-access-bundle). At [`claude.ai/admin-settings/claude-tag`](https://claude.ai/admin-settings/claude-tag), open **Access bundles** in the left navigation, click into a bundle (or **Create** one), and go to its **Credentials** tab.</Note>

Connecting Salesforce lets Claude read accounts, contacts, opportunities, and cases (and write, if you grant it) from any channel under the bundle's scope. Add it as a custom credential with **Connect another tool**, using the OAuth 2.0 JWT bearer flow; Salesforce has no preset button in the picker.

## Create the credential in Salesforce

Create a Connected App configured for the JWT bearer flow, with a dedicated integration user assigned to it. Salesforce's guide is at [help.salesforce.com](https://help.salesforce.com/s/articleView?id=xcloud.remoteaccess_oauth_jwt_flow.htm).

You'll need from Salesforce:

* The Connected App's **Consumer Key** (client ID)
* The **private key** from the certificate you uploaded to the Connected App
* The integration user's **username** (the JWT subject)
* Your org's login URL (`https://login.salesforce.com` for production, `https://test.salesforce.com` for sandboxes, or your My Domain)

Assign the integration user a Permission Set scoped to the objects and fields Claude should reach. Read-only is the recommended starting point.

## Add the connection to a bundle

In the bundle, click **Connect another tool** and choose the credential type below.

| Field                   | Value                                                                                             |
| :---------------------- | :------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| Credential type         | **OAuth 2.0 JWT bearer**                                                                          |
| Issuer (iss)            | The Connected App's Consumer Key                                                                  |
| Subject (sub, optional) | The integration user's username                                                                   |
| Private key (PEM)       | The private key (PEM) from your certificate                                                       |
| Token URL               | `https://login.salesforce.com/services/oauth2/token` (or your My Domain `/services/oauth2/token`) |
| Allowed websites        | Your Salesforce instance host (for example `yourorg.my.salesforce.com`)                           |

The Agent Proxy injects the credential at the network boundary; the model and the sandbox are not given the key. See [how Agent Proxy works](/claude-tag/concepts/agent-identity#agent-proxy).

## Verify the connection

In a channel under the bundle's scope, in a new thread:

```text wrap theme={null}
@Claude list the five most recently modified Opportunities in Salesforce.
```

Check the integration user's login history in Salesforce Setup to confirm the call landed under that user.
