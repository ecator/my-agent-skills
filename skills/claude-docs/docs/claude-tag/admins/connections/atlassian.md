# Connect Jira and Confluence

> Connect Atlassian Cloud to Claude Tag so it can read and update Jira issues and search Confluence pages. Covers creating an API token, which credential type to pick, and the host to allow.

export const BetaNote = () => <Info>Claude Tag is in public beta. Features and behavior described here may change before general availability.</Info>;

<BetaNote />

<Note>Connections are added inside an [Access bundle](/claude-tag/admins/add-connections#your-first-access-bundle). At [`claude.ai/admin-settings/claude-tag`](https://claude.ai/admin-settings/claude-tag), open **Access bundles** in the left navigation, click into a bundle (or **Create** one), and go to its **Credentials** tab.</Note>

Connecting Atlassian Cloud lets Claude read and search Confluence pages and read, comment on, and update Jira issues from any channel under the bundle's scope. Jira and Confluence don't have a preset Connect button, so you add them through **Connect another tool** as a [custom connection](/claude-tag/admins/connections/custom). One credential covers both products on the same Atlassian site.

This is an HTTP API connection, not an MCP server or a personal claude.ai connector. Pair it with a plugin that covers Jira and Confluence so Claude knows how to call the API; see [Attach plugins](/claude-tag/admins/add-connections#attach-plugins).

## Create the credential in Atlassian

Create a dedicated Atlassian account for Claude (for example `claude@yourcompany.example.com`) and add it to the Jira projects and Confluence spaces it should reach. The connection can read whatever this account can read, so a dedicated account keeps Claude's reach to exactly what you grant it.

Sign in as that account and create an API token at [id.atlassian.com/manage-profile/security/api-tokens](https://id.atlassian.com/manage-profile/security/api-tokens). Atlassian shows the token once; store it somewhere you can retrieve it.

## Add the connection to a bundle

On the bundle's **Credentials** tab, click **Connect another tool**.

| Field            | Value                                              |
| :--------------- | :------------------------------------------------- |
| Name             | A label such as "Atlassian (Jira and Confluence)"  |
| Credential type  | **Basic**                                          |
| Username         | The dedicated account's email address              |
| Password         | The API token from Atlassian                       |
| Allowed websites | `your-domain.atlassian.net` (your site's hostname) |

Atlassian Cloud's REST APIs authenticate with HTTP Basic, where the username is the account email and the password is the API token. An API token sent as a Bearer header is not accepted on Atlassian Cloud; pick **Basic**, not **Bearer**.

The Agent Proxy injects the credential at the network boundary; the model and the sandbox are not given the key. See [how Agent Proxy works](/claude-tag/concepts/agent-identity#agent-proxy).

<Note>Atlassian Data Center (self-hosted) uses a personal access token sent as a Bearer header instead of Basic auth. For a Data Center instance, pick **Bearer** as the credential type and add your instance's hostname under **Allowed websites**. The instance must be reachable from the public internet.</Note>

## Verify the connection

In a channel under the bundle's scope, in a new thread, ask Claude to fetch one issue or page by key or URL. The call lands under the dedicated account in Atlassian's audit log.

```text wrap theme={null}
@Claude can you read PROJ-123 from Jira?
```

New connections apply to new threads only.
