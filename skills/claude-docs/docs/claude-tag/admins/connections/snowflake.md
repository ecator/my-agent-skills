# Connect Snowflake

> Connect Snowflake to Claude Tag so it can run read-only queries on your warehouse. Snowflake has no preset, so it is added as a custom credential.

export const BetaNote = () => <Info>Claude Tag is in public beta. Features and behavior described here may change before general availability.</Info>;

<BetaNote />

<Note>Connections are added inside an [Access bundle](/claude-tag/admins/add-connections#your-first-access-bundle). At [`claude.ai/admin-settings/claude-tag`](https://claude.ai/admin-settings/claude-tag), open **Access bundles** in the left navigation, click into a bundle (or **Create** one), and go to its **Credentials** tab.</Note>

Connecting Snowflake lets Claude run queries against your warehouse from any channel under the bundle's scope. Add it as a custom credential with **Connect another tool**; Snowflake has no preset button in the picker.

This is an HTTP API connection, not a personal claude.ai connector.

## Create the credential in Snowflake

Create a dedicated Snowflake user for the agent with a read-only role scoped to the databases and schemas Claude should query. Generate a programmatic access token for that user.

Snowflake's guide for the SQL REST API and authentication is at [docs.snowflake.com](https://docs.snowflake.com/en/developer-guide/sql-api/authenticating).

## Add the connection to a bundle

In the bundle, click **Connect another tool** and choose **Bearer**. Bearer is the only supported credential type for Snowflake; key-pair authentication is not currently supported.

| Field            | Value                                                                                                                            |
| :--------------- | :------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Credential type  | **Bearer**                                                                                                                       |
| Custom headers   | Add a row with **Name** `Authorization`, **Prefix** `Bearer `, and **Value** set to the programmatic access token from Snowflake |
| Allowed websites | `<your-account>.snowflakecomputing.com`                                                                                          |

Replace `<your-account>` with your Snowflake account identifier. To change the host later, open the **⋮** menu on this connection in the bundle's Credentials tab and choose **Edit**.

The Agent Proxy injects the credential at the network boundary; the model and the sandbox are not given the key. See [how Agent Proxy works](/claude-tag/concepts/agent-identity#agent-proxy).

## Verify the connection

In a channel under the bundle's scope, in a new thread:

```text wrap theme={null}
@Claude what can you access from this channel?
```

Snowflake appears in the list once the connection is live. New connections apply to new threads only.
