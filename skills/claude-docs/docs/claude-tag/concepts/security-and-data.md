<BetaNote />

In channels, Claude acts under its own service accounts that an Owner provisions. By default it can read and post in Slack channels it's been added to and search public channels by keyword; it has no access to your external systems until an Owner adds connections. Each connection is scoped to specific channels and workspaces, and the actions Claude takes in connected tools are attributable to its own service accounts.

Every channel request, whether a person typed it or a schedule triggered it, follows the same path: it runs in a sandbox Anthropic hosts, leaves that sandbox only through Agent Proxy, and reaches your systems under the agent's own accounts. DMs run on the user's own claude.ai account instead and are covered separately on [How agent identity works](/claude-tag/concepts/agent-identity#direct-message-channels).

## How a request travels

Each Slack thread runs in its own sandbox, and every outbound call from that sandbox passes through the same checkpoints.

### Compute and the sandbox

Sessions run in sandboxes Anthropic hosts, the same managed compute behind [Claude Code on the web](https://code.claude.com/docs/en/web-quickstart). Each Slack thread gets its own sandbox.

When a thread goes quiet, its sandbox is released; replying in the thread builds a fresh one. What persists across that release and rebuild:

* **Persists:** The thread, its visible work, and anything pushed to a branch, opened as a pull request, or posted into Slack.
* **Does not persist:** Files that existed only inside the sandbox. To keep generated files, ask Claude to push them to a branch or post them in the thread.

Claude Tag retains channel memory and session transcripts. Because of that retention, Claude Tag isn't available to organizations with Zero Data Retention (ZDR) enabled.

### Credential storage

Credentials you provision are kept in a separate credential store, not in the proxy itself. When an outbound request matches a rule, [Agent Proxy](/claude-tag/concepts/agent-identity#agent-proxy), the network layer between the sandbox and any external host, retrieves the credential from that store and injects it at the boundary, so the model and the sandbox are not given the key.

This means:

* **A saved credential is not displayed again.** The setup screens are write-only.
* **The credential travels only to the hosts you named** when you added the connection.
* **You can narrow the credential further**, to one host, one path prefix, or read-only methods, in [Add connections](/claude-tag/admins/add-connections).

### Network egress

Outbound traffic from a channel session's sandbox is default-deny. Requests go only to hosts an allow layer covers, and the layers are a [connection's Allowed websites](/claude-tag/admins/connections/custom#fill-out-the-connect-another-tool-form), the [bundle's Domains tab](/claude-tag/admins/add-connections#allow-a-host-without-a-credential), and the network access setting of the [environment](/claude-tag/concepts/glossary#environment) the scope's sessions run on. A new environment's Trusted default already covers a [documented set of package registries and developer hosts](https://code.claude.com/docs/en/claude-code-on-the-web#default-allowed-domains). Every request gets one of three outcomes:

* **Matches a credential rule.** The credential is attached at the boundary and the request proceeds.
* **Matches only an allowlist.** The host is on the Domains tab or allowed by the environment's network access setting; the request is sent without credentials.
* **Matches nothing.** The request is blocked outright; the host is unreachable rather than merely unauthenticated.

Because requests to any other host are blocked, data can only leave the sandbox to hosts an allow layer covers. An admin sets the Allowed websites list on each connection and the Domains tab on each bundle. The environment's network access setting lives on the environment at [`claude.ai/code`](https://claude.ai/code) and defaults to the Trusted level. See [Set allowed websites](/claude-tag/admins/add-connections#set-allowed-websites) and [Allow a host without a credential](/claude-tag/admins/add-connections#allow-a-host-without-a-credential).

Organizations can opt in to allow-all egress, where a `*` entry on a bundle's Domains tab admits requests to any host on the ports that entry lists, still without credentials. Private and internal network addresses and cloud metadata endpoints remain blocked. Allow-all egress is off by default and enabled per organization by Anthropic; see [Allow all hosts](/claude-tag/admins/add-connections#allow-all-hosts).

### Service accounts

In channels, Claude acts under service credentials of its own, not under the account of the person who tagged it. The Slack surface is the Claude app, code work goes through the Claude GitHub App, and every other connected tool uses a service account an Owner provisions in an Access bundle. See [How agent identity works](/claude-tag/concepts/agent-identity) for the full model.

A connection belongs to that agent identity and is shared by everyone the bundle's scope covers. Anyone in a channel under that scope can ask Claude to act with the credential, so whatever the connected account can read or write is available to every member of those channels. Connect a dedicated identity you control for each service, such as a `claude@yourcompany.example.com` seat or a native service account, rather than a personal login. A dedicated account keeps the agent's actions separately auditable in each tool's logs and lets you revoke its access without affecting a person; see [Create a dedicated account per service](/claude-tag/admins/add-connections#create-a-dedicated-account-per-service).

DMs with `@Claude` run on the user's own claude.ai account instead, with that user's personal connectors, and work there is attributed to them. Personal connectors apply only in DMs, never in channels. Admins can disable DMs organization-wide; see [Allow or disable direct messages](/claude-tag/admins/restrict-access#allow-or-disable-direct-messages).

## Member access

By default, anyone in a connected Slack workspace can invoke Claude in channels, with or without a Claude account. An Owner or Admin can turn on a restriction toggle to narrow that: on Team plans it limits Claude to people with a Claude account in your organization, and on Enterprise plans it limits Claude to members whose role grants the **Claude Tag in Slack** capability. See [Restrict who can use Claude](/claude-tag/admins/restrict-access#members). The toggle governs DMs as well as channels.
