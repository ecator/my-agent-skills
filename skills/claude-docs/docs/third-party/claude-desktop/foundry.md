# Deploy Claude Desktop on 3P with Microsoft Foundry

> Set up Microsoft Foundry, choose an authentication path for your organization, and configure Claude Desktop on 3P to use Claude models on Microsoft Foundry

This page walks an IT administrator through a Microsoft Foundry deployment: creating the Microsoft Foundry resource, choosing the authentication path that fits your organization, and pushing the managed configuration. If you only need the list of configuration keys, skip to [Configure the app](#configure-the-app).

<Note>
  Claude models in Microsoft Foundry are available in two hosting options, Hosted on Azure and Hosted on Anthropic. Anthropic acts as an independent processor for Microsoft, and customers are subject to Anthropic's data use terms. For deployments hosted on Azure, prompts and completions remain within Azure; only usage metadata and content flagged by Anthropic's safety systems egress to Anthropic. Deployments hosted on Anthropic run on Anthropic's infrastructure. See [Claude in Microsoft Foundry](https://platform.claude.com/docs/en/build-with-claude/claude-in-microsoft-foundry#hosting-options) for details.

## Set up Azure

These steps are performed once per Azure subscription. You need permission to create resources and, for in-app sign-in, to register an application in Microsoft Entra ID.

<Steps>
  <Step title="Create a Microsoft Foundry resource">
    In the Azure portal, create a Microsoft Foundry resource in your subscription. Record the **resource name**; the app constructs the endpoint as `<resource-name>.services.ai.azure.com`.
  </Step>

  <Step title="Deploy the Claude models">
    In the Microsoft Foundry portal for your resource, deploy the Claude models you intend to serve. Record each **deployment name**; you will list these in `inferenceModels`.
  </Step>

  <Step title="Obtain an API key (API-key approach only)">
    If you chose the API-key approach, copy one of the resource's keys from the Azure portal. You will place it in the managed configuration in [Configure the app](#configure-the-app).
  </Step>

  <Step title="Register an Entra ID application (in-app sign-in only)">
    If you chose in-app Entra ID sign-in, register an application in the [Microsoft Entra admin center](https://entra.microsoft.com) under **Identity → Applications → App registrations → New registration**. On the registration:

    * Under **API permissions**, select **Add a permission**, find **Azure Cognitive Services** in the API picker, and add the **Delegated** permission **user\_impersonation** so the issued token is accepted by your Microsoft Foundry resource. (The app requests this permission as the scope `https://cognitiveservices.azure.com/.default`.) Both sign-in flows need it. After adding the permission, select **Grant admin consent**; in tenants that disable user consent, sign-in fails with error code `AADSTS65001` until consent is granted.
    * Under **Authentication**, complete the setup for the sign-in flow you plan to use (see [In-app Entra ID sign-in](#in-app-entra-id-sign-in) for how the flows differ):
      * For the device-code flow (the default), enable **Allow public client flows**. Entra ID rejects device-code sign-in without it.
      * For the browser flow (`inferenceFoundryAuthFlow` set to `browser`), select **Add a platform → Mobile and desktop applications** and add the redirect URI `http://127.0.0.1/callback`. Use the literal address `127.0.0.1`, not `localhost`: Entra ID matches the scheme, host, and path exactly and ignores only the port. The browser flow completes sign-in without **Allow public client flows**. Conditional Access policies that block the device-code authentication flow do not apply to the browser flow.

    Record the **Directory (tenant) ID** and **Application (client) ID**.

    Grant the users or groups who will sign in a role on the Microsoft Foundry resource that permits inference (for example, **Cognitive Services User**).
  </Step>
</Steps>

## Prepare devices

What each end-user device needs depends on the authentication approach you chose.

### API key

No per-device preparation is required. Place the resource's API key in the managed configuration as `inferenceFoundryApiKey`.

### In-app Entra ID sign-in

No per-device preparation is required. Distribute `inferenceFoundryTenantId` and `inferenceFoundryClientId` in the managed configuration. To use the browser flow instead of the default device-code flow, also set `inferenceFoundryAuthFlow` to `browser`.

When the tenant and client IDs are set and `inferenceCredentialKind` is `interactive`, the app shows a **Sign in with Microsoft** page the first time a user opens the Cowork tab. Clicking the button starts a sign-in against `login.microsoftonline.com`; what the user sees depends on `inferenceFoundryAuthFlow`:

* **Device code** (the key is unset or `device-code`): the app displays a short verification code and opens the Microsoft sign-in page in the default browser, where the user enters the code and approves access.
* **Browser** (the key is `browser`): the app opens the Microsoft sign-in page in the default browser, where the user signs in and approves access. The browser shows a confirmation page and the user switches back to the app; there is no code to enter.

On success, the app stores the refresh token encrypted with the operating system's secure storage (Keychain on macOS, DPAPI on Windows) and returns to the Cowork tab. Both flows store the same token against the same app registration, so changing `inferenceFoundryAuthFlow` later does not itself prompt users to sign in again.

If the stored refresh token expires or is revoked, the app shows a **Sign in again** prompt; clicking it reopens the Microsoft sign-in page in the browser.

`inferenceFoundryTenantId` and `inferenceFoundryClientId` can be set only via an MDM profile, not via a bootstrap server. `inferenceFoundryAuthFlow` can be set via either.

<Note>
  In-app sign-in and a [bootstrap server](/third-party/claude-desktop/bootstrap) are separate layers that work together. In-app sign-in supplies each user's inference credential, the Entra ID token that authorizes model calls. A bootstrap server supplies per-user configuration values when the app starts. A bootstrap server does not replace sign-in: a deployment with a bootstrap server still needs each user to sign in, and signing in does not deliver configuration.
</Note>

#### Allow network egress

The sign-in flow reaches `login.microsoftonline.com` in addition to your Microsoft Foundry endpoint. Both hosts are included automatically in the **Egress Requirements** section of the in-app configuration window when these keys are set.

## Configure the app

Open the in-app configuration window (**Developer → Configure Third-Party Inference…**). In the **Connection** section, set **Inference provider** to **Foundry**, then fill in the **Foundry credentials** card with the values for whichever authentication approach you chose:

| Field                          | API key                 | In-app Entra ID sign-in                                    |
| ------------------------------ | ----------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------- |
| Azure AI Foundry resource name | `your-foundry-resource` | `your-foundry-resource`                                    |
| Azure AI Foundry API key       | your resource key       | *leave empty*                                              |
| Entra ID tenant ID             | *leave empty*           | `00000000-0000-0000-0000-000000000000`                     |
| Entra ID client ID             | *leave empty*           | `11111111-1111-1111-1111-111111111111`                     |
| Entra ID sign-in flow          | *leave empty*           | `browser`, or leave empty for the default device-code flow |

Under **Models**, add at least one **Model list** entry using the Microsoft Foundry deployment name.

Then click **Export** to produce a `.mobileconfig` (macOS) or `.reg` (Windows) file for your MDM. See [Deploy with MDM](/third-party/claude-desktop/mdm) for the export and deployment workflow.

### Configuration keys

The full set of `inferenceFoundry*` keys is below. Set `inferenceProvider` to `foundry`, supply the resource name, and provide exactly one credential source.

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="inferenceFoundryAuthFlow details">
    The browser flow sends a loopback redirect URI, so the app registration must include "[http://127.0.0.1/callback](http://127.0.0.1/callback)" under the "Mobile and desktop applications" platform (Entra ignores the loopback port, but not the path), and it works with "Allow public client flows" disabled. Conditional Access policies that block the device-code authentication flow do not affect the browser flow. App versions that predate this key always use device code.

You must also set `inferenceModels` to a list of Microsoft Foundry deployment names. See the [Configuration reference](/third-party/claude-desktop/configuration#inferencemodels).

## Troubleshoot

To confirm which keys the app read and whether credentials validated, use **Help → Troubleshooting → Copy Managed Configuration Report**; see [Verifying the deployment](/third-party/claude-desktop/installation#verifying-the-deployment) for that workflow and the common causes when the app does not enter 3P mode. Application log locations are listed in [Data storage and residency](/third-party/claude-desktop/data-storage).

If sign-in fails at the token step, confirm the **Azure Cognitive Services** permission is granted and consented on the app registration. For the device-code flow, also confirm **Allow public client flows** is enabled; Entra ID rejects device-code sign-in without it.

If sign-in fails with error code `AADSTS650057`, the **user\_impersonation** permission is missing from the app registration. Add it under **API permissions**.

If sign-in fails with error code `AADSTS65001`, the permission has not been consented. Select **Grant admin consent** on the **API permissions** page, or have the user accept the consent prompt if your tenant allows user consent.

If browser-flow sign-in fails in the browser with error code `AADSTS50011`, the redirect URI is missing from the app registration or does not match. Add `http://127.0.0.1/callback` under **Authentication → Mobile and desktop applications**, using the literal address `127.0.0.1`, not `localhost`.

If the browser shows the confirmation page but in-app sign-in still fails, with error code `AADSTS7000218` in the application logs, the redirect URI is registered under the **Web** platform. Move it under **Mobile and desktop applications**.

Each sign-in attempt has a time limit: five minutes for the device-code flow and two minutes for the browser flow. If the user does not finish within the limit, the attempt fails and the user can click **Sign in with Microsoft** to start again.
