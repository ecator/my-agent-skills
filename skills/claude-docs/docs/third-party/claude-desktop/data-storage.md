# User identity and local data

> How Claude Desktop on 3P identifies users and where it stores conversations, settings, and credentials on disk

Claude Desktop on third-party (3P) has no Anthropic account. There is no sign-in step, no cloud-stored conversation history, and no per-user state on Anthropic infrastructure. Identity and persistence are entirely local to the device.

## Identity

When the app first launches in 3P mode, it generates a random UUID and writes it (base64-encoded) to the `ant-did` file in the application-data directory. This identifier, together with the `deploymentOrganizationUuid` from your managed configuration, is what's attached to telemetry events. It is random per device and per OS-user account, and Anthropic cannot trace it back to a real device or person.

If you need to attribute Claude Desktop activity to named users, configure [OpenTelemetry export](/third-party/claude-desktop/configuration#otlpendpoint) and join the exported events to your identity system on the collector side, or include user identity in the headers your `managedMcpServers` helpers emit.

## Where data lives

Claude Desktop on 3P stores everything under a dedicated directory, separate from standard Claude Desktop, so the two modes can coexist on one machine without interfering.

| Platform | Application data                           | Logs                                   |
| -------- | ------------------------------------------ | -------------------------------------- |
| macOS    | `~/Library/Application Support/Claude-3p/` | `~/Library/Logs/Claude-3p/`            |
| Windows  | `%LOCALAPPDATA%\Claude-3p\`                | (under the application-data directory) |

<Note>
  On Windows, earlier Claude Desktop releases stored this data under `%APPDATA%\Claude-3p\` (the Roaming profile). On first launch after upgrading, the app moves the existing directory to `%LOCALAPPDATA%` automatically; if Roaming is redirected to a network share, conversation history and configuration are copied and large regenerable caches are re-downloaded. Update any external tooling, backup jobs, or endpoint policies that reference the old path. macOS paths are unchanged.

Files in this directory are written with owner-only permissions so other OS accounts on the same machine cannot read them.

The logs directory contains `main.log` (application and configuration-validation events), `cowork_vm_node.log` (sandbox VM activity), `claude.ai-web.log` (renderer events), and `mcp.log` / `mcp-server-<name>.log` (MCP connection events).

Separately from the application-data directory, Claude Desktop writes user-visible outputs (Artifacts and scheduled-task results) to `~/Claude/` in your home directory, or `~/Documents/Claude/` on legacy installs. This folder is intended for you to browse directly and is not removed when you delete the application-data directory.

## Memory

During Cowork sessions, Claude writes short Markdown files recording what it has learned about the user — working preferences, project context, and corrections — and reads them at the start of subsequent sessions. These files live under `local-agent-mode-sessions/.../memory/memory/` and never leave the device.

Users can review and delete individual entries, or pause memory entirely (existing files are kept but not read or updated), under **Settings → Cowork → Memory**. The same page exposes a **Global instructions** editor for the `CLAUDE.md` file that is included in every session.

## Credentials

Inference credentials are handled according to how they're delivered:

* **Managed configuration** (for example, `inferenceGatewayApiKey`, `inferenceBedrockBearerToken`): read from the OS preference store or registry at launch and held in memory. The app also writes resolved credentials to a small set of transient, owner-only files for its own session processes, described below.
* **OAuth tokens** (in-app Google sign-in, MCP servers with `oauth: true`): stored in the application-data directory, encrypted with the operating system's secure storage (Keychain on macOS, DPAPI on Windows).
* **Credential-helper output**: held in memory for `inferenceCredentialHelperTtlSec` seconds, then discarded and re-fetched.

### Transient credential files

Parts of each session run as separate processes: the sandbox VM for Cowork sessions, and the Claude Code runtime for Code tab sessions. Processes that cannot receive credentials through an in-memory channel read them from short-lived files that the app writes for them. All of these files are created with owner-only permissions and are cleaned up automatically:

| Path (within the application-data directory) | Contents                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            | Lifecycle                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   |
| -------------------------------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `host-creds-<random-id>.json`                | The resolved inference credential (bearer token or API key, plus the endpoint), as environment values for background Claude Code worker processes. Written atomically with owner-only permissions (mode `0600` on macOS; per-user ACLs on Windows).                                 | Rewritten on each credential refresh; deleted when the app quits; leftovers from a crash are removed at the next launch. The random path segment is regenerated when you sign out of the inference provider or its credentials are rotated, so a process holding the old path loses access. |
| `ccd-session-secrets/<session-id>/`          | File-based credentials for Code tab sessions: Google Cloud application default credentials for Google Cloud's Agent Platform, or AWS configuration files for Amazon Bedrock. The directory is created with owner-only permissions (mode `0700` on macOS; per-user ACLs on Windows). | Created when the session starts; removed when the session ends; the whole directory is swept before the next Code tab session starts and when you sign out of the inference provider.                                                                                                       |
| Per-session working directory                | For Cowork sessions, the same file-based credentials (Google Cloud's Agent Platform and Amazon Bedrock) are written into the session's working directory, which is mounted into the sandbox VM.                                                                                     | Scoped to the session; removed with the session directory.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  |

Aside from these files, credentials delivered through managed configuration are held in memory only.

## Removing data

To fully reset a device's Claude Desktop on 3P state, delete the application-data directory above and the `~/Claude/` user-files folder. To return to standard Claude Desktop without removing data, choose the Anthropic sign-in option on the sign-in screen; to also remove the locally authored 3P configuration, delete the `configLibrary/` directory.

Conversation history exists only in this directory, so deleting it is unrecoverable.
