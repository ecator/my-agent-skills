> Feature comparison between Claude Enterprise and Claude Desktop on third-party (3P)

The tables below compare the feature set of Claude Desktop on third-party (3P) to Claude Enterprise.

## Key differences

**Configuration.** Claude Enterprise uses a web-based admin console. Claude Desktop on 3P is configured entirely via [MDM](/third-party/claude-desktop/mdm) (Jamf, Intune, Group Policy) or a [bootstrap server](/third-party/claude-desktop/bootstrap), with no Anthropic-hosted admin interface.

**Telemetry.** Claude Desktop on 3P sends usage and debugging metrics only, and these can be fully disabled via managed configuration. Claude Enterprise does not offer telemetry toggles. See [Telemetry and egress](/third-party/claude-desktop/telemetry).

**Inference.** Claude Desktop on 3P routes all inference through the provider you configure. For Google Cloud's Agent Platform and Amazon Bedrock, data handling is governed by Google Cloud and Amazon Bedrock respectively. For Microsoft Foundry deployments hosted on Azure, prompts and completions remain within Azure; only usage metadata and content flagged by Anthropic's safety systems egress to Anthropic. Deployments hosted on Anthropic run on Anthropic's infrastructure. See the [Microsoft Foundry page](/third-party/claude-desktop/foundry) for details.

**Pricing.** Claude Desktop on 3P is token-based consumption billed by your cloud provider, with no seat licensing.

**Features not available in 3P.** Features marked with — are absent from the UI. Users see a clean interface without error states for unavailable features.

† Memory in Claude Desktop on 3P is stored on the device, not on Anthropic infrastructure. Users can review, delete, or pause it under **Settings → Cowork → Memory**; see [Memory](/third-party/claude-desktop/data-storage#memory). Chat-history search and nightly summary generation are Chat-tab features and are not applicable in 3P.
