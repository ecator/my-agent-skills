> Every managed-configuration key Claude Desktop on 3P supports, what it controls, and recommended security profiles

<Tip>Most settings on this page are easier to configure in the [in-app configuration window](/third-party/claude-desktop/in-app-configuration). Use this reference when you're scripting an MDM policy or bootstrap response by hand.</Tip>

Claude Desktop on third-party (3P) is configured entirely through OS-native managed preferences: a `.mobileconfig` profile on macOS, registry policy on Windows, or a root-owned JSON file on Linux. This page documents every supported key. For the desktop release each key first appeared in, see the [configuration changelog](/third-party/claude-desktop/configuration-changelog).

The easiest way to author a configuration is the in-app configuration window (**Developer → Configure third-party inference**), which validates values, shows per-provider requirements, and exports directly to `.mobileconfig` or `.reg`. Use this reference when you need to author policy by hand, audit an existing profile, or understand exactly what a key does.

## How keys are read

| Platform | Managed (MDM) location                                                            | Local (user) location                                    |
| -------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------- |
| macOS    | `/Library/Managed Preferences/<user>/com.anthropic.claudefordesktop.plist`        | `~/Library/Application Support/Claude-3p/configLibrary/` |
| Windows  | `HKLM\SOFTWARE\Policies\Claude` (machine), `HKCU\SOFTWARE\Policies\Claude` (user) | `%LOCALAPPDATA%\Claude-3p\configLibrary\`                |
| Linux    | `/etc/claude-desktop/managed-settings.json`                                       | `~/.config/Claude-3p/configLibrary/`                     |

The local location is a directory: `_meta.json` records which saved configuration is applied, and each configuration is a `<id>.json` file alongside it. The in-app configuration window writes here.

When a managed source is present, it wins and locally written values are ignored. The exception is a managed source that sets only the update keys (`disableAutoUpdates` and `autoUpdaterEnforcementHours`): those two keys are enforced from the managed source, but the rest of the configuration stays local and user-editable. Configuration is read **once at launch**, so fully quit and reopen the app after any change. On Windows, the two policy hives are not merged: when machine policy is present under `HKLM\SOFTWARE\Policies\Claude`, the app ignores `HKCU\SOFTWARE\Policies\Claude` entirely; [Deploy the configuration](/third-party/claude-desktop/mdm#4-deploy-the-configuration) has the exact rule. See [Deploy with MDM](/third-party/claude-desktop/mdm#update-keys-and-managed-precedence) for the full precedence rules.

### Value types

Write every value as a **string** in the OS preference store, even booleans and arrays.

| Documented type  | What to write                                                          | Example                                       |
| ---------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------- | --------------------------------------------- |
| string           | Plain string                                                           | `vertex`                                      |
| boolean          | `"true"` or `"false"` (or `1` / `0`)                                   | `"true"`                                      |
| integer          | Decimal string                                                         | `"3600"`                                      |
| string\[] (JSON) | JSON array **encoded as a string** (not a native plist/registry array) | `["claude-sonnet-4","claude-opus-4"]`         |
| object (JSON)    | JSON object mapping name to value, as a string                         | `{"X-Org-Id":"team1"}`                        |
| object\[] (JSON) | JSON array of objects, as a string                                     | see [`managedMcpServers`](#managedmcpservers) |

<Warning>
  The most common configuration mistake is writing array- or object-typed keys as native plist/registry structures. Keys like `inferenceModels`, `inferenceGatewayOidc`, `managedMcpServers`, `coworkEgressAllowedHosts`, and `otlpHeaders` must be **JSON strings**. In a `.mobileconfig`, that means a single `<string>` element containing `[...]` or `{...}` — not an `<array>`, not a `<dict>`, and not separate keys with dotted names like `inferenceGatewayOidc.clientId`.
</Warning>

On Windows, write registry values as `REG_SZ`, directly under the policy key rather than nested in a subkey (the app never reads subkeys). `REG_DWORD` is also accepted for boolean and integer keys and is read as its decimal value. Avoid `REG_EXPAND_SZ`: the app counts it toward machine policy being present but cannot read its contents. The app cannot see `REG_QWORD`, `REG_MULTI_SZ`, or `REG_BINARY` values at all.

### Linux

The managed source on Linux is a single JSON file, `/etc/claude-desktop/managed-settings.json`, with keys at the top level exactly as named in the [reference](#reference) — no wrapper object, no nesting:

```json theme={null}
{
  "inferenceProvider": "gateway",
  "inferenceGatewayBaseUrl": "https://gateway.example.com/v1",
  "inferenceGatewayApiKey": "sk-example",
  "inferenceCustomHeaders": { "X-Tenant-Id": "acme" }
}
```

Because the file is real JSON, array- and object-typed keys use native JSON values — the string-encoding rule above applies to plist and registry sources only. (String-encoded values are also accepted, so a profile generated for another platform can be reused.)

The file is only honored when it can't be edited by the user it configures:

* `managed-settings.json` must be a regular file (not a symlink), owned by root, and not group- or world-writable.
* `/etc/claude-desktop` itself must be a directory (not a symlink), owned by root, and not group- or world-writable.

A file that fails these checks is ignored, and the reason is logged to `main.log` in the app's logs directory — `~/.config/Claude/logs/` (or `~/.config/Claude-3p/logs/` once the app is running in 3P mode); search for `managed-settings.json`. The same log names any key that fails schema validation.

There is no per-user managed location on Linux; per-user configuration goes through the in-app configuration window, which writes to the local `configLibrary` directory above.

## Reference

The reference below is generated from the configuration schema and grouped to match the sidebar of the in-app configuration window. The **Availability** column shows whether a key can be set in an MDM profile, returned from a [bootstrap server](/third-party/claude-desktop/bootstrap), or both.

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="inferenceCustomHeaders details">
    Sent on every inference and model-discovery request (joined into the CLI's `ANTHROPIC_CUSTOM_HEADERS`).

    Use this for fleet-wide constants. For per-user or per-session values, have the **credential helper script** emit JSON with a `headers` field; those are merged over these static entries (helper wins on conflict).
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="inferenceCredentialHelper details">
    Claude runs the executable with no arguments and reads **stdout** (trimmed). Exit code must be `0`; any output on **stderr** is logged but ignored. **Stdout must contain only one of the formats below** (no banners, prompts, or log lines).

    **Output format** is either:

    * a single bare token (the API key / bearer token), or
    * a JSON object `{"token": "...", "headers": {"Name": "Value", ...}}` when per-request headers are needed (merged over **Custom inference headers**, helper wins on conflict)

    Result is cached for the TTL below. On TTL expiry the helper is re-invoked transparently (no user prompt, no relaunch).

    **Expiry and refresh:** the app checks the active credential's expiry before each turn and refreshes silently when possible (re-runs the helper, or uses the stored refresh token for interactive sign-in kinds). If the provider returns HTTP 401 mid-turn, the same silent refresh is attempted before surfacing an error. When silent refresh fails, a prompt appears with a provider-specific action (re-sign-in for interactive kinds; admin-contact for static credentials). Applies to all providers and both tabs.

    **Typical use:** a shell script that pulls from Keychain, 1Password CLI, or an internal secret broker. Example:

    `security find-generic-password -s anthropic-api -w`

    If this field is set, static credential fields (API key, bearer token) are ignored. The helper always wins.

  <Accordion title="inferenceProvider details">
    The app activates 3P mode only when this is set and the required credential keys for the selected provider are present and valid; otherwise it launches in standard mode. Keys for providers other than the selected one are ignored. Each provider's required keys are documented on its dedicated page under Inference providers.

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="inferenceFoundryAuthFlow details">
    The browser flow sends a loopback redirect URI, so the app registration must include "[http://127.0.0.1/callback](http://127.0.0.1/callback)" under the "Mobile and desktop applications" platform (Entra ignores the loopback port, but not the path), and it works with "Allow public client flows" disabled. Conditional Access policies that block the device-code authentication flow do not affect the browser flow. App versions that predate this key always use device code.

| <span id="inferencegatewayapikey" />Gateway API key<br />`inferenceGatewayApiKey`             | `string` | MDM + Bootstrap | —        | API key for the configured inference gateway.                                                                                                                                                                                                   |
| <span id="inferencegatewayauthscheme" />Gateway auth scheme<br />`inferenceGatewayAuthScheme` | `enum`   | MDM + Bootstrap | `bearer` | How the gateway credential is sent on the wire (Authorization: Bearer vs x-api-key header). One of: `bearer`, `x-api-key`. Defaults to `bearer`.                                                                                                |
| <span id="inferencegatewayoidc" />Gateway SSO IdP (OIDC)<br />`inferenceGatewayOidc`          | `object` | MDM + Bootstrap | —        | External IdP for gateway sign-in. The user authenticates against this issuer; the resulting token (ID token by default) is sent to the gateway as the Bearer credential. Leave unset only if the gateway is its own OAuth authorization server. |

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="inferenceGatewayOidc details">
    **External IdP mode.** The app discovers `<issuer>/.well-known/openid-configuration`, runs an OIDC authorization-code-with-PKCE flow in the system browser with `clientId`, and sends the resulting token as `Authorization: Bearer` on every inference request — see **Bearer token type** below for how the gateway validates it.

    **Bearer token type.** `id_token` (the default) sends the OIDC ID token — the gateway validates signature + `iss` + `aud`, where `aud` is the `clientId` configured here. `access_token` sends the OAuth access token — the gateway validates as an OAuth resource server against the audience/scope the IdP issued the token for; set `scopes` to the gateway's registered API scope (required in this mode). Use `access_token` for gateways that expect a resource-server token (Portkey, Kong, Envoy JWT filter, AWS API Gateway authorizers).

    **The gateway MUST validate `iss` AND `aud`, not just the signature.** Signature + issuer alone accepts *any* token from the same tenant, including tokens issued to unrelated apps. In `id_token` mode the audience is the `clientId`:

    ```yaml theme={null}
    # LiteLLM example — `audience` is REQUIRED, not optional
    general_settings:
      litellm_jwtauth:
        public_key_url: https://login.microsoftonline.com/<tenant>/discovery/v2.0/keys
        audience: <clientId>           # ⚠ omitting this accepts any token from the tenant
    ```

    **IdP setup.** The app's loopback callback binds `http://127.0.0.1:<port>/callback` (RFC 8252 §7.3). Register `127.0.0.1`; most IdPs do **not** treat `localhost` and `127.0.0.1` as interchangeable. **Entra:** register a public-client app, add a *Mobile and desktop applications* redirect URI of `http://127.0.0.1/callback`. (Microsoft's docs say the path is wildcarded for loopback; in practice it is not: `http://127.0.0.1` without `/callback` fails with `AADSTS50011`. The port IS wildcarded.) Grant `openid profile email offline_access` (delegated, no admin consent); in `access_token` mode **also** add the gateway API's delegated permission under *API permissions* (and ensure the gateway's own app registration exposes that scope via *Expose an API*) — without it Entra rejects the sign-in with `AADSTS65001`. **Okta:** register a *Native* app with the exact redirect URI `http://127.0.0.1:<port>/callback` and set `redirectPort` here to that port (Okta requires an exact match).

    **Refresh:** `offline_access` returns a refresh token; the app refreshes the bearer silently before expiry. When refresh fails (revoked, idle past the IdP's window), the user re-authenticates in the browser. **Google Workspace caveat (`id_token` mode only):** Google never returns `id_token` on a refresh-token grant, so a Google-backed gateway in `id_token` mode will prompt a browser sign-in roughly once per ID-token TTL (\~1h). Entra and Okta return a fresh `id_token` and are unaffected; `access_token` mode is unaffected on all IdPs.

    **Leave this unset** for a gateway that hosts its own RFC 8414 metadata at `<baseUrl>/.well-known/oauth-authorization-server` (the original gateway-as-AS path).

### Models

| ------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ---------- | --------------- | ------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| <span id="modeldiscoveryenabled" />Model discovery<br />`modelDiscoveryEnabled` | `boolean`  | MDM + Bootstrap | —       | Auto-populate the model picker from the provider at launch.          |
| <span id="inferencemodels" />Model list<br />`inferenceModels`                  | `object[]` | MDM + Bootstrap | —       | Override the auto-discovered model list. First entry is the default. |

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="modelDiscoveryEnabled details">
    Auto-populate the model picker from the provider's model-list endpoint at launch. For gateway and Anthropic providers, a config that doesn't set this key skips discovery automatically when the model list below already makes it unnecessary; the toggle here only sets it explicitly on or off. Turn off if the endpoint isn't reachable from your network, or to use a fixed list. When off, the model list below is required and must use full model IDs (aliases like sonnet/opus are resolved via discovery).
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="inferenceModels details">
    Use the **provider's exact model ID**: Vertex publisher IDs (`claude-sonnet-4@20250514`), Bedrock inference-profile IDs (`us.anthropic.claude-sonnet-4-...-v1:0`), or Foundry deployment names. The first entry is the default. Entries may be plain ID strings or objects.

    **Gateway:** the `name` must be the exact ID your gateway's `/v1/models` endpoint returns. If you set `supports1m` on an alias (`sonnet`) but discovery returns the full ID, the variant won't appear.

    **Extended context** (`supports1m`) is a capability assertion you make about your deployment; only set it for models you've confirmed support the 1M-token window:

    ```json theme={null}
    [{"name": "claude-opus-4", "supports1m": true}, "claude-sonnet-4"]
    ```

    **Display label** (`labelOverride`) is for IDs the picker can't derive a friendly name from (Bedrock ARNs, gateway routing aliases). Display-only; `name` is still what the app sends:

    ```json theme={null}
    [{"name": "arn:aws:bedrock:us-east-1:123:application-inference-profile/abc", "labelOverride": "Claude Opus (Prod)"}]
    ```

    **Tier mapping** (`anthropicFamilyTier`) tells the app which Claude tier (`haiku`/`sonnet`/`opus`/`fable`/`mythos`) an entry stands in for, so bare tier aliases (e.g. in the Code tab) resolve to your model. `isFamilyDefault: true` picks the winner when several entries share a tier:

    ```json theme={null}
    [{"name": "us.anthropic.claude-opus-4-...-v1:0", "anthropicFamilyTier": "opus"}]
    ```

    | `anthropicFamilyTier` | `enum`    | —       | Which Claude tier this model stands in for. Pins the bare alias (e.g. 'opus') and, for opus/fable, the refusal fallback. One of: `sonnet`, `opus`, `haiku`, `fable`, `mythos`. |
    | `isFamilyDefault`     | `boolean` | —       |                                                                                                                                                                                |

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="autoModeEnabled details">
    When enabled, users can select **Auto mode** (Code tab) / **Act without asking** (Cowork tab). Claude runs a safety classifier on each action and only prompts for approval on actions it judges risky, instead of following the static per-tool policy.

    Requires a model that supports the classifier (Claude 4.6+). Older models show the option greyed out. `builtinToolPolicy` and this key may both be set; Auto mode is a user-selectable option alongside the default policy, not a replacement for it.

    In the Code tab, a separately deployed Claude Code [managed-settings](https://claude.com/docs/third-party/claude-desktop/code#interaction-with-claude-code%E2%80%99s-own-managed-settings) file that sets `disableAutoMode` to `"disable"` overrides this key and keeps Auto mode hidden.

  <Accordion title="allowedWorkspaceFolders details">
    Paths can reference `~` and these environment variables, expanded per user: `%OneDrive%`, `%OneDriveCommercial%`, `%OneDriveConsumer%`, `%APPDATA%`, `%LOCALAPPDATA%`, `%USERNAME%`, `%XDG_DOCUMENTS_DIR%`. The set is fixed; an entry that references any other `%VAR%`, or one that is unset on the device, is ignored.

  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="coworkEgressAllowedHosts details">
    Applies to **both** the Cowork and Code tabs. In the Cowork tab it governs the sandbox's web fetch, shell commands, and package installs. In the Code tab it is [translated into Claude Code's network sandbox allowlist](https://claude.com/docs/third-party/claude-desktop/code#applied-as-managed-policy); a separately deployed Claude Code managed-settings file on the endpoint takes precedence by default.

    Does **not** apply to Web Search, which runs server-side at your inference provider rather than from the sandbox.

    Only affects **tool calls**. Inference and MCP traffic are covered by their own allowlists elsewhere. When unset, only the inference endpoint is reachable from the sandbox; the agent's package installs (pip/npm) and web fetches will fail with a 403.

    Accepts exact hostnames (`api.github.com`), wildcards (`*.corp.com` matches one subdomain level), and `*` to allow all. `*.corp.com` matches `docs.corp.com` but not `corp.com` itself; add both if you need the apex. IP literals and localhost always resolve regardless of this list; this is a public-egress filter, not a sandbox.

    Hosts you add here also need to be open on your network firewall. See **Egress Requirements** for the full allowlist.

    For OAuth-authenticated entries, the app builds the redirect URI as `http://<callbackHost>:<callbackPort>/callback`; register that exact value with the OAuth provider. Tokens refresh automatically during a session, so users aren't interrupted when the initial access token expires.

    `toolPolicy` locks the per-tool approval state, keyed by tool name. Keys may contain `*` wildcards (`"read_*"` matches every tool whose name starts with `read_`; matching is anchored and `*` is the only wildcard, identical to Claude Code permission-rule globs). An exact-name key wins over matching wildcard keys, with two exceptions in the stricter direction: in the Code tab, forwarded `blocked`/`ask` wildcard rules take precedence over a less strict exact key, and in chat approval flows and always-allow persistence a wildcard `ask` key keeps every matching tool behind a per-call prompt (no persistent always-allow) even when a more permissive exact-name key matches — for direct (imperative) tool invocations such as artifact or widget tool calls, the exact-name key still decides. When several wildcard keys match a tool, the strictest applies (blocked > ask > allow). `"blocked"` removes the tool from the session and labels it admin-blocked. `"ask"` requires approval on every call (Allow once / Deny only; no persistent always-allow). `"allow"` pre-approves. Tools **not listed** follow the user's choice: the prompt offers a persistent Always allow, except for tools that can modify data, which instead show a session-scoped **Allow for this task** alongside **Allow for all tasks** with a malicious-instruction warning. In the Code tab, `blocked`/`ask` are forwarded as Claude Code permission rules; `allow` is not.

    For the bundled Microsoft 365 connector, the send tools (`outlook_send_mail`, `outlook_send_draft`, `outlook_forward_mail`, `outlook_create_event`, `outlook_update_event`) cannot be loosened below `ask` — an `allow` setting resolves to `ask`.

Not used for auth. |
| <span id="disableessentialtelemetry" />Block essential telemetry<br />`disableEssentialTelemetry`          | `boolean` | MDM only        | `false` | Crash and performance reports to Anthropic.

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="disableEssentialTelemetry details">
    "Essential" means the signals Anthropic needs to keep your deployment working: **crash stacks**, **startup failure reasons**, and **version/OS metadata**. No prompts, completions, file contents, or identifiers beyond a random install ID.

    **What you lose when this is on:** when a Cowork build hits a bug that only reproduces on your OS version or locale, Anthropic can't see it unless a user manually reports. Fixes ship slower.

    **Why this is discouraged, not blocked:** some air-gapped environments require zero outbound telemetry as a matter of policy. The switch exists for them. If you don't have that constraint, leave it off.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="disableNonessentialTelemetry details">
    "Nonessential" covers two things: **product-usage analytics** (which features get used, navigation patterns; no prompts or completions) and the **Send** action in Help → Generate Diagnostic Report. Turning this on stops both.

    Destination for both: `claude.ai`. Already listed under Egress Requirements → Nonessential telemetry.

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="otlpContentCapture details">
    Each category enables a class of raw content in OpenTelemetry events sent to your collector (this data never reaches Anthropic). `userPrompts` — user-typed prompt text. `assistantResponses` — assistant message text. `toolDetails` — tool input arguments, e.g. the web-search query string. `toolContent` — tool output content, e.g. fetched page text or command stdout. `rawApiBodies` — full inference API request and response bodies. These mirror Claude Code's `OTEL_LOG_*` env vars; see the [Claude Code monitoring docs](https://code.claude.com/docs/en/monitoring-usage).

    Applies `toolPolicy` locks to MCP servers that arrive via the org-plugins directory, keyed by server name. Either shape is accepted; when hand-authoring a profile, use the legacy record shape until your fleet floor parses the canonical array form:

    If a Managed MCP servers entry and an org-plugin server share a name, the Managed MCP servers entry wins and its `toolPolicy` (if any) applies; the entry here for that name is ignored.

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="bootstrapOidc details">
    Set this to use a separate identity provider (Microsoft Entra ID, Okta, Ping, or any compliant OIDC provider) for the bootstrap sign-in. The app runs an authorization-code-with-PKCE flow in the system browser. Omit to use device-code mode against the bootstrap server's own origin.

    This is an **object-typed key** — in an MDM profile it is a single JSON-string value, not separate keys with dotted names like `bootstrapOidc.clientId`. Writing the sub-fields as separate registry values causes the app to silently fall through to device-code mode.

## Guides

### Recommended security profiles

The profiles below are illustrative examples rather than built-in presets, and the labels are descriptive only. Use them as starting points and adjust for your environment. Layer the inference-provider keys for your cloud on top of whichever profile you choose.

<Tabs>
  <Tab title="Standard">
    Recommended for most enterprise deployments. Telemetry and auto-updates stay on so Anthropic can diagnose issues and ship fixes; users can extend Claude Desktop with their own connectors.

    | Key                                                                           | Value              |

    | [`autoUpdaterEnforcementHours`](#autoupdaterenforcementhours)                 | `24`               |
    | [`isDesktopExtensionSignatureRequired`](#isdesktopextensionsignaturerequired) | `true`             |
    | [`otlpEndpoint`](#otlpendpoint)                                               | `<your-collector>` |
  </Tab>

  <Tab title="Restricted">
    For regulated environments that need to control what users can connect Claude Desktop to, while keeping Anthropic supportability.

    | Key                                                             | Value                             |

    | [`disableNonessentialServices`](#disablenonessentialservices)   | `true`                            |

  </Tab>

  <Tab title="Locked down">
    For air-gapped or maximally restricted environments. **The only traffic leaving the device goes to your inference endpoint and OTLP collector.** With this profile, Anthropic has zero remote visibility, so your team owns log collection and update distribution.

    | Key                                                             | Value                             |
